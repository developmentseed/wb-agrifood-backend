Despite a remarkable progress made on reducing poverty in recent years, reaching the targets remains challenging. The decline in poverty has been uneven. The poverty reduction in recent years was dominated by the East Asia and Pacific (notably China and Indonesia) and South Asia (notably India) (World Bank, 2017). Despite the progress made so far, the number of extreme poor remains high, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. In many countries, vast differences in poverty levels persist at the subnational level. In addition, global problems such as climate change, fragility, economic crises and food security pose great risks for poverty reduction, and they are often trans-border issues, which generate strong positive or negative externalities across neighboring countries.</p>",

Weil) Quarterly Journal of Economics</p>\n<p>We explore the role of natural characteristics in determining the worldwide spatial distribution of economic activity, as proxied by lights at night, observed across 240,000 grid cells. A parsimonious set of 24 physical geography attributes explains 47% of worldwide variation and 35% of within-country variation in lights. We divide geographic characteristics into two groups, those primarily important for agriculture and those primarily important for trade, and confront a puzzle. In examining within-country variation in lights, among countries that developed early, agricultural variables incrementally explain over 6 times as much variation in lights as do trade variables, while among late developing countries the ratio is only about 1.5, even though the latter group is far more dependent on agriculture. Correspondingly, the marginal effects of agricultural variables as a group on lights are larger in absolute value, and those for trade smaller, for early developers than for late developers.  We show that this apparent puzzle is explained by persistence and the differential timing of technological shocks in the two sets of countries.  For early developers, structural transformation due to rising agricultural productivity began when transport costs were still high, so cities were localized in agricultural regions. When transport costs fell, these agglomerations persisted. In late-developing countries, transport costs fell before structural transformation. To exploit urban scale economies, manufacturing agglomerated in relatively few, often coastal, locations. Consistent with this explanation, countries that developed earlier are more spatially equal in their distribution of education and economic activity than late developers.</p>\n<p>This dataset is part of the Global Research Program on Spatial Development of Cities funded by the Multi-Donor Trust Fund on Sustainable Urbanization of the World Bank and supported by the U.K. Department for International Development.</p>\n",

Consumer tax equivalents are also provided for the covered products in each focus country, along with value of production and consumption at undistorted prices and of trade for each covered product and for non-covered farm products.

Tariff data on agricultural and manufacturing goods are combined with household survey data on detailed income and expenditure patterns to estimate the first-order effects of the elimination of import tariffs on household welfare. The paper assesses how these welfare effects vary across the distribution by estimating impacts on the consumption of traded goods, wage income, farm and non-farm family enterprise income, and government transfers. For each country, the income gains and the inequality costs of trade liberalization are quantified and the trade-offs between them are assessed using an Atkinson social welfare index. The analysis finds average income gains from import tariff liberalization in 45 countries and average income losses in nine countries. Across countries in the sample, the gains from trade are 1.9 percent of real household expenditure on average. We find overwhelming evidence of a trade-off between the income gains (losses) and the inequality costs (gains), which arise because trade tends to exacerbate income inequality: 45 countries face a trade-off, while only nine do not. The income gains typically more than offset the increase in inequality. In the majority of developing countries, the prevailing tariff structure thus induces sizable welfare losses</p>\n",

        "description": "<p>This dataset provides five flood scenarios for Greater Dhaka Area, with estimates of location-specific depth and duration of inundation, for extreme rainfall event in 2050.</p>\n<p>Intense rainfall floods Dhaka, Bangladesh, one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing megacities, year in and year out. Low-lying flood plains, rivers, and canals that once drained water are gradually filling up as a result of indiscriminate urbanization, and now magnify, rather than help solve the problem. The climatic outlook for South Asia in the 21st century signals heavier and more erratic rainfall during the monsoon season, according to the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the World Meteorological Organization.  Thus, climate change may further aggravate Dhaka\u2019s flood vulnerability.</p>\n<p>Dhaka needs to better manage its flood drainage infrastructure and strengthen the city\u2019s climate-disaster resilience and adaptive capacity.  But climate-smart policies require local planners to better understand the likely damage from current flooding, potential damage from climate-related risks, measures that can be taken to cope with current and future flooding as well as adaptation costs.</p>\n<p>In an effort to enhance such understanding and to provide input to development of adaptation policies, this research estimated location-specific depth and duration of inundation from extreme rainfall events by 2050 with or without climate change, discussed structural adaptation measures to cope with current and future flooding, evaluated the reduction in inundation resulting from implementing these measures, and estimated adaptation cost.</p>\n<p>Depth and duration of inundation in Greater Dhaka Area from extreme rainfall events by 2050 with or without climate change under different scenarios at ward/ thana-level have been summarized in the Excel Workbook \u201cUrban Flooding of Greater Dhaka in 2050\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>Detailed Study Area:</strong><br />\nThe dataset covers Greater Dhaka Area: Eastern Dhaka, Western Dhaka-Goranchatbari, Western Dhaka-Kallyanpur, Central Dhaka, Old Dhaka, DND and Narayanganj.</p>\n<p>As flooding is a periodic problem in Dhaka, the city can be said to already have an <em>adaptation deficit even without climate change</em>. The analysis therefore addressed the issue from both current and future climate perspectives.</p>\n<p>**Future (2050) Rainfall Extreme Scenarios: **</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Dhaka experienced 341mm rainfall in 24 hours in September 2004; and this historic extreme rainfall was taken as the current climate baseline in the underlying analysis.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>For the future, the underlying analysis considered a 16 percent increase in extreme rainfall in a changing climate by 2050.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Assumptions about the Future:</strong><br />\nAs any change in land use has implications for the percentage of built-up area, and therefore drainage of the storm water, the analysis assumed that future land cover would change according to the RAJUK\u2019s Detailed Action Plan (DAP). For drainage, the analysis assumed that all improvements to Dhaka\u2019s drainage infrastructure, both planned and proposed by the relevant drainage-system authority, would be implemented.</p>\n<p><strong>Five Alternative Scenarios:</strong><br />\nEstimates of location-specific depth and duration of inundation were estimated for extreme rainfall event in 2050 for following five scenarios:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Scenario1:  341mm rainfall in 24 hours</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As timing and magnitude of climate change is somewhat unknown, ward/thana-level inundation depth and duration for 2050 were generated for the baseline rainfall event without consideration of any climate change. The analysis accounts for expected socioeconomic changes and planned changes in the land use pattern as well as drainage infrastructure.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Scenario 2: 341mm rainfall in 24 hours without adaptation deficit</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The estimates of inundation from scenario1 were discussed with the local experts and based on their recommendations a set of potential adaptation measures - for example increase in pump capacity, sludge cleaning, laying of new drainage pipes, deepening existing water bodies - was designed and incorporated in hydrological modeling. The modeling was repeated with different capacities of pumps etc. until a desirable depth and duration of inundation for each study region was attained.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Scenario 3: 396mm rainfall in 24 hours</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ward/thana-level estimates of inundation depth and duration were generated for the changing climate in 2050 taking into account climate change - using a potential 16 percent increase in extreme rainfall as a factor as well as accounting for expected socioeconomic changes, planned changes in the land use pattern and drainage infrastructure.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Scenario 4: 396mm rainfall in 24 hours without adaptation deficit</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Implications for flooding were estimated in a changing climate after current climate adaptation deficit is met.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Scenario 5: 396mm rainfall in 24 hours without adaptation deficit and with adaptation for climate change</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Implications for a set of adaptation measures suggested by local experts to deal with climate change were estimated.</p>\n<p>These estimates are from the three-step hydrological modeling component of the study.  The first modeling step simulated basin-level flows from the Brahmaputra River in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna River system since they strongly influence monsoon-season river flows and water levels in the Greater Dhaka area.  In the second step, the effects of climate change on the regional rivers were simulated.  Finally, in the third step, detailed modeling of the drainage system in and around Dhaka city was simulated. The analysis centered on the worst-case scenario in which river levels are high and all sluice gates are closed. Therefore, there is no gravity drainage out of the city and the drainage system depends primarily on the performance efficiency of drainage pumps, which is often the case during intense rainfall.  For Western Dhaka-Old Dhaka, Central Dhaka, Kallyanpur, and Goranchatbari\u2014the impacts of climate change on river flooding were not considered in the analyses as this main part of the city is protected by flood embankments on all sides.</p>\n<p><strong>See Urban Flooding of Greater Dhaka in a Changing Climate- Building Local Resilience to Disaster Risk: chapters 2, 3 and 6 for details.</strong></p>\n<p>These estimates were prepared by Asif Zaman, World Bank Consultant and Water Resources and DSS Specialist, Institute of Water Modeling.

In a panel of over 350 subnational regions, we find that drier conditions increase urbanization in places most likely to have an urban industrial base. Total city income in such places also increases. When receiving cities have a traded good sector that is not wholly dependent upon local agriculture, migration to cities provides an \u201cescape\u201d from negative agricultural moisture shocks. However, in most places (75% of our sample) without an industrial base, there is no escape into alternative export-based employment. Drying causes reduced urban and rural incomes, with little overall impact on the urban population share. Finally, the paper shows that climate variation also induces employment changes within the rural sector itself. Drier conditions induce a shift out of farm activities, especially for women, into non-farm activities, and especially out of the measured work force. Overall, these findings imply a strong link between climate and urbanization in Africa.</p>\n<p>This dataset is part of the Global Research Program on Spatial Development of Cities funded by the Multi-Donor Trust Fund on Sustainable Urbanization of the World Bank and supported by the U.K. Department for International Development.</p>\n",

The status in each category is graded \"High, Medium, Low,\" with assigned values of 2, 1 and 0 respectively. For each UNCED country report, all twenty-five questions are answered for each element of the matrix in Table 1. With 20 elements in the matrix, 500 assessment scores are developed for each country.</p>\n",

In a nutshell, the OTRI is a more sophisticated way to calculate the weighted average tariff of a given country, with the weights reflect the composition of import volume and import demand elasticities of each imported product. The empirical methodology of the OTRI was first developed in Kee, Nicita and Olarreaga (2008, 2009), based on the theoretical underpinning of Anderson and Neary (1994, 1996, 2003). Irwin (forthcoming) also uses a similar methodology to study the historic protection level of the US, from 1867 to 1961. Recently, Kee, Neagu and Nicita (forthcoming) applied a fixed weight version of OTRI to study protectionism of a wide range of countries during the crisis period.</p>\n<p>The OTRI and some other related indices, such as the Trade Restrictiveness Index (TRI) and the Market Access Overall Trade Restrictiveness Index (MAOTRI) are computed annually when new trade flows and tariff data are available. These indices feed into the Global Monitoring Report, an annual World Bank publication joint with the International Monetary Fund. The latest indices and the underlying trade data and elasticity estimates can be download from below. Please cite Kee, Nicita and Olarreaga (2008, 2009) if you are using the elasticity estimates, the OTRI, TRI, MAOTRI or the Ad-Valorem Equivalent of Non-tariff measures of any given country.</p>\n",

        "description": "<p>As the fate of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) hangs in balance, an evaluation of what it offers could inform current decisions and shape future negotiations. The TPPs services component has been hailed as one of the agreement's major accomplishments. To assess the agreement's impact on national policy in the major services sectors, we created a new public database. This database reveals that TPP commitments seldom go beyond countries' applied policies, suggesting the explicit liberalization resulting from the agreement is limited only to a few countries and a few areas. However, the TPP enhances transparency and policy certainty because parties' services commitments cover more trading partners, more sectors and are in some cases closer to applied policies than their commitments under previous agreements. Furthermore, new TPP rules, including on state-owned enterprises, government procurement and competition policy, could enhance services market access. In particular, the TPP breaks new ground in prohibiting restrictions on international data flows, while at the same time creating unprecedented obligations on all parties to protect consumers from fraud and protect privacy. These dual obligations on importing and exporting countries represent a model for regulatory cooperation that could elicit greater market opening if applied to other areas.</p>\n",
