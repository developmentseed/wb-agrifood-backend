The poverty reduction in recent years was dominated by the East Asia and Pacific (notably China and Indonesia) and South Asia (notably India) (World Bank, 2017). Despite the progress made so far, the number of extreme poor remains high, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. In many countries, vast differences in poverty levels persist at the subnational level.
