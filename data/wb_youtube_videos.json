This is the first of some very special episodes\nwe've got for you here, where we're exploring how to end poverty on a livable planet, and\nwhat a livable planet really means. Today, we'll be turning our attention to climate\nchange. And as I speak to you, the 28th UN Climate\nSummit, or COP28, is already underway. The focus there is on cutting emissions, adaptation,\nand solutions that can address the challenges of a world that is warming far too quickly. We'll hear about the urgent need for climate\naction from the Prime Minister of the Pacific Island Nation of Samoa. Fiam\u0113 Naomi Mata'Afa: We know what the challenge\nis. We know the targets that we need to reach\nif we are to survive. Srimathi Sridhar: From youth activists urging\nthe international community to ensure a livable planet for their future. Brianna Fruean: I felt like I was blessed\nto grow up in paradise, and a very big problem that I felt was about to take away this paradise\nfor me was climate change. Srimathi Sridhar: We'll get the big picture\nfrom the UN. Inger Andersen: If we look at 10% of the highest\nincome population, they are responsible for 48% of all emissions. The bottom 50% of the world population, they\nare responsible for just 12% of emissions.",

We need to double down on them, accelerate\nthem, push them, support them. Srimathi Sridhar: All that and more, coming\nup in The Development Podcast's special limited series on a livable planet. The climate crisis is about as urgent as a\nglobal issue can be. This year's COP summit in Dubai comes off\nthe back of the hottest year on record, where forest fires, droughts, extreme weather and\nflooding became news day after day. The 2015 Paris Agreement target to limit global\ntemperature increases to 1.5 degrees is a key benchmark. COP28 will see the first stock take of global\nclimate action and the Paris Agreement.

For young people, especially those in parts\nof the world where climate change has a very visceral effect, the crisis is something they\nhave grown up with, and many as our producer, Sarah Treanor found out, are using their voice\nto call for action. Sarah Treanor: Pacific Island nations have\nbeen at the sharp edge of climate change for years, with rising sea levels, extreme weather\nand coastal erosion, to name but a few of the urgent challenges facing this group of\nsmall countries. For many young people, job prospects too have\nbeen impacted by the climate crisis. So, I spoke to one young activist who has\nbeen raising her voice on the issues facing her home country of Samoa since she was a\nsmall child. Brianna Fruean: [foreign language]. My name is [foreign language] Brianna Fruean. So, [foreign language] is my Samoan chiefly\nname, and I do climate work. Sarah Treanor: I asked Brianna to describe\nto me a sense of what it was like growing up. Brianna Fruean: Picture perfect, picturesque,\nclear waters, white sandy beaches, type beach you see in a postcard. I was always surrounded by waterfalls and\nlush gardens and forests growing up.",

I was always surrounded by waterfalls and\nlush gardens and forests growing up. It really was as cliche as it sounds. I felt like I was blessed to grow up in paradise. And of course, not saying that paradise didn't\nhave its problems, but a very big problem that I felt was, about to take away this paradise\nfor me was climate change. Sarah Treanor: Brianna said that she didn't\nreally think about climate change. Brianna Fruean: Until I learned about coral\nbleaching, and that's when everything clicked to me where I was thinking, \"Okay, no wonder\nwhy the fish stock at the fish market is not looking the same as when I was five years\nold.\" And I would pick up on the conversations my\ndad would be having with the fishermen and the fisher folk saying that, \"Oh, their boat\ncouldn't make it further enough to catch more fish. Because of the warming oceans, the fish were\ngoing further and further out into the ocean.\" From these small little things like the visual\nchange of fish stock to the big things like the cyclone and actually physically being\nin a cyclone, being in two and three cyclones from the age of 10 to the age of 15.

She said that her first cyclone she experienced\nwas when she was 19, and so I started to physically and emotionally encapsulate what climate change\nwas because I realized that I was living in it. Sarah Treanor: And is there an event you can\nrecall, Brianna, where it really all started to seem very urgent? Brianna Fruean: I think the first shift of\nland that I really had to deal with, or be a part of a conversation around it, was the\nshift in grave sites. So in Samoa, we believe that those who have\npassed on should be laid to rest with the best views. And so, a lot of our villages, we bury our\nancestors near the ocean so that they have a view of the ocean. And then, I started hearing conversations\nin my family and my community of moving grave sites because the ocean was coming closer\nand closer and cracking the concrete of the graveyards. And that was the first shock to my system\nand the injustice for Samoan and Samoan family, to have to dig up their dead and move them\nand wake them from their rest.",

Brianna Fruean: And you do become very aware\nof the sound of the ocean. There's almost no escaping that sound. I was in Tuvalu when there was a cyclone in\nFiji. One of the nights where the winds was really\nstrong and there was a large tide in big waves that came crashing into the road, the rocks\nof the seawall completely scattered across the road. And I was on a motors bike with my cousins,\nand we were riding through and the wheels and my feet were touching ocean water because\nthe ocean had completely come onto the road. And so, you become very aware of how, I guess,\nimmediate and how urgent the climate crisis is for small atoll nations.

Brianna Fruean: There's so much that's interwoven\ntogether with language, the physical environment around us, the way we dance. It's all tied together with the land. So, the [foreign language], the dance of our\nculture, it mimics the way of the ocean. It mimics the actions of the birds and the\nsway of the leaves of the trees when it's windy out. And so, all of these elements that are a part\nof Samoa's land and Samoa's landscapes is interwoven and very much the roots of our\ndance. And the same goes for language. A lot of the words in which we used to express\nourselves are the words of the trees, are the words that mean different animals and\ndifferent insects. It's also deeply woven into our tattooing\nhistory. If you're looking after Samoan culture and\npeople, you're looking after Samoa as the island and as the landscape\nSrimathi Sridhar: Thanks to Brianna and Sarah.

Fiam\u0113 Naomi Mata'Afa: We have probably one\nof the smallest economic zones because of our geographical placing. We're sort of like in the middle of the Pacific\nOcean. If there's a significant impact of climate\nchange for our people here, the more immediate ones of course is the experience because most\nof our villages are coastal. It's very immediate. The other immediate impact, and I suppose\nthis is also part of the development processes, the clearing of land, especially going upland\nwhere there is water catchment areas. There's the erosion then from the inline side\nwhere there's been encroachment on water catchment areas. So, it's a mix of climate change and development\nprogress. The economies of small island states, they're\nreally always on a back foot. So, to make that progress is very difficult. So perhaps, I could say, in the last 30 years\nsince the early '90s, we've had about five major incidences in Samoa, related to climate\nchange.",

I don't think the tsunami we can count on\nclimate change. You're always sort of on a back foot, because\nyou're at least looking at the impact on us has to do with infrastructure and the blocking\nthem of access, whether it's internal or external access, trading supplies, and so forth. And of course, not to mention the domestic\ncosts to families with homes and private properties, and so forth. Srimathi Sridhar: You mentioned homes and\nprivate properties. What are some infrastructure challenges, and\nhow are you working with partners like the World Bank to overcome them? Fiam\u0113 Naomi Mata'Afa: One of the major infrastructure\nprojects, especially with the World Bank and other partners, is the main road between Apia,\nthe capital, and the airport. So, that's a very key highway for connectivity,\nwhich also ties in with the airport developments and the ports on that side of the island that\nlinks where our pier is, to our other bigger island, Savai'i.

So, all those projects are interwoven. We also have a number of what we call cross-island\nroads. And so, we have a major project that is just\nabout to start that connects the north coast of this island, Tuvalu, to the southern coast. That will be quite a significant upgrade. For the big island in Savai'i, we of course\nhave the roading infrastructure. The infrastructure there holds up quite well. But with Savai'i, there's been a large investment\nin water. We're possibly looking at a hydro project\nthere, but there've been issues around landholding with the villages and the communities. So, I think we have to be a lot more inclusive\nin the consultation process so that communities understand the objective is to ensure our\nservices to that large island.

Srimathi Sridhar: You're a trailblazer in\nregional politics, and the first female Prime Minister of Samoa. How do you see the role of women developing? Fiam\u0113 Naomi Mata'Afa: So, when you look through\nthe gender lens and the role and the function of women, it's still very much family-based. The social construct hasn't reached an economic\nstage where there are services that can take that burden off women, right? They still very much carry that with the impact\nof climate change, on top of it. Srimathi Sridhar: And Prime Minister, what\nare other challenges that Samoa is facing, and what does it need to do to overcome them? Fiam\u0113 Naomi Mata'Afa: It's education. It's very key.

The health area is still very much a challenge\nfor Samoa. So, when you are looking at a population and\ntheir health statistics aren't good, and you're looking at the education, they're not good,\nthen you really do need to revise where you put your priorities.

Fiam\u0113 Naomi Mata'Afa: Well, I don't think\nthere's anything new. We've been talking about this for a long time. We know what the challenge is. We know the targets that we need to reach\nif we are to survive the 1.5, and also the resourcing to be able to respond, and the\nequity around how do we distribute that.

I live in Accra, Ghana. I am most concerned by the lack of concern\nfor the climate crisis in general. So, for example, in Accra, Ghana, when I was\ngrowing up and when I was a child, if I wanted to drink a bottle of Coke, I would be sent\nto the store with a basket and a napkin, and that's how we bought our stuff. And somewhere along the line, plastic bags\nwere introduced, and now the entire city is littered. Our gutters are choked with plastic. There's plastic in our grounds. It's everywhere. And the same way we chose as individuals to\nchange to plastic bags to cause the problem, we can switch back to tote bags and reusable\nbags to become the solution in some way to this problem. So, a livable planet is one that has clean\nwater, is one that has adequate temperatures for different species, different plants, different\nanimals to grow and to live a good quality",

These are the underlying threats to stability\nof planet earth as we know it. First, crisis, obviously the climate crisis. I think everybody understands that. And look, if you look at the numbers, 86 days\nrecorded with super hot temperatures just this past year, the hottest September on record,\nand we are already at 1.8 degrees above pre-industrial levels. So, we are not in a good place. So, I think people get the climate crisis. The second crisis we speak about is the nature\nand biodiversity loss crisis.

But 1 million species of the nearly 8 million\non this planet are threatened by overuse, by fragmentation, by climate change, by chemicals,\nand so on. And that obviously is quite concerning. And then, when we look at ecosystem loss,\nlike 10 football pitches a minute, loss of tropical primary forest and so on, these are\nreal issues. So, that's a nature loss crisis. And lastly, we speak about the pollution and\nwaste crisis, that toxic trail of our own civilization. Now, we need to have jobs and industry and\neconomy to keep the wheels turning, but we cannot afford to do that while we thrash our\nplanet. Srimathi Sridhar: And I think this is a good\nsegue to UNEP's Emissions Gap Report. I'm seeing here that the report looks at where\ngreenhouse gas emissions are predicted to be in 2030, versus where they actually should\nbe to avert some of the worst impacts of climate change. So, can you tell me more about this year's\nreport and how far off track are we?",

So, the report is a sober read, a read that\ncomes out and we always issue it immediately prior to the COP. And exactly as you say, it measures that gap,\nright, between where we are and where we should be. And we can now say that we are looking at\nan emission of 57.4 gigatons of CO2 in 2022, and that that's an increase between '21 and\n'22, an increase of 1.2%. So, that's a worry. And when we look at the G20, who together\nare responsible for 76% of all emissions, let me say that again. 20 countries are responsible for 76% of emissions. So that's an important point that I always\ntry to emphasize. When we look at that and we see that G20 countries\nwho have that responsibility to reduce have actually increased, that's a concern.

If we then say the conditional NDCs, I.e.,\nif there is money, we will also, it takes us to 2.5 degrees in 2100. None of the above are acceptable, none of\nthe above. Which then means that the stock take will\nhave to therefore mean that all countries, but especially the G20 will have the biggest\nemissions load, will have to really, really stretch. And that's what we need to see by, if we want\nto hit the 1.5, which last year we called the report the closing window, we have to\ncut emissions by nearly 50%, by 42% by 2030. If we want to hit two degrees, which we really\ndon't, we have to cut it by 28%, not increase. I mean, we keep calling out the G20 because\nthat is where we have this 76% of all emissions.

I mean, we keep calling out the G20 because\nthat is where we have this 76% of all emissions. But there's also huge injustice, right? Because if we look at 10% of the highest income\npopulation, they are responsible for 48% of all emissions. So, and if we look at the bottom 50% of the\nworld population, they are responsible for just 12% of emissions. So, we have a lot of work to do. Srimathi Sridhar: And what do you think are\nsome of the urgent actions that governments, private sector, multilateral institutions\ncan take to help correct this course? And where do you think we really need to double\ndown on investments? Inger Andersen: Double down obviously on the\nenergy transition, and the energy transition has to be in the electricity sector, in the\nindustry sector, in the transport sector, but also in how we do our buildings, and in\nagriculture and food, as well as in the finance sector. And that's where we'll find the mitigation\nopportunities. And for sure, IFIs and the private sector\nhave a real role to play.

But the IFIs can lead the way by investing\nin smart and green, whether it's transport and enabling e-mobility through smart interventions,\nwhether they be budget support type that would shift incentives at the national level, or\nwhether it be on the industry, whether it's building codes and so on. And these kind of things can now really be\ntaken to scale. And it needs regulatory settings for sure,\nbut it also needs an investment climate that is good for private sector, so that private\nsector could come in, and of course an opportunity to do feed in tariffs and things of this nature,\nwhich I think a number of countries are doing. That's on the mitigation side. On the adaptation side, we have to double\ndown because unfortunately, we have not been mitigating enough, so climate change is here\nand now. And so, really thinking about investing in\nresilient infrastructure. Srimathi Sridhar: So Inger, given your long\ncareer in the environment, are there any solutions that you've seen that you'd consider to be\npotential game changers for the planet? Inger Andersen: Back in the late '70s, scientists\ncame out, and actually told us, \"There's a hole in the ozone layer on both sides of the\npole. This is not a good thing. It's going to have all these impacts that\nwe need to understand.\"",

My biggest concern when it comes to climate\nchange is in the way it affects our food systems. So, for Egypt, our summers are getting longer\nand hotter, our winters are shorter and milder. This is concerning because it affects the\nlivelihoods of farmers and makes access to nutritious food even more difficult and expensive.

Srimathi Sridhar: So, where does the World\nBank play a role? We got the inside view from Anna Bjerde, the\nWorld Bank's Managing Director of Operations. Anna Bjerde: Well, thank you so much for having\nme on the podcast. I'm super excited, and love that the theme\nof course is climate change. I care deeply about it. And I do love our new vision, which is end\npoverty on a livable planet. Why I love it is because at the end of the\nday, our core objective and core work at World Bank is about ending poverty. But the fact that we're adding on a livable\nplanet means so much, because it recognizes that we are about people and the planet, and\nthe two go hand in hand. And the planet, a livable planet means, of\ncourse, climate change, environmental stewardship, but it also means things like health services\nand access to energy and clean water and clean air.",

What do you think could be considered climate\ngame changers for us? Anna Bjerde: There are quite a few of them,\nbut the ones that give me a real sense of hope, if I can put it that way, and I think\nthey're actually achievable and tangible, are on the mitigation side, definitely the\nenergy transition. By 2027, we anticipate that solar will surpass\ncoal as the most available source of energy. And I think that is because we have seen the\ncost curve go down. We have seen countries around the world put\na bet on solar, and it's starting to show. But also, the energy transition has to come\nwith what we also call a just transition. As we phase out one old way of doing things\nand introduce a new way of doing things, we need to make sure we don't leave anyone behind. As we might see some jobs drop off, we need\nto make sure we're focusing on the creation of new jobs, which means re-skilling, engaging\npopulations that are affected often in areas that are quite concentrated with the old way\nof doing things.

Srimathi Sridhar: So, let's talk about financing\nclimate action, Anna. Where do you see the gaps, and tell me what\nthe World Bank is kind of doing in this area? Anna Bjerde: So, the needs for financing climate\naction are huge, and there's many things that we need to do. First and foremost, we need to make sure that\nwe work both on reducing emissions, that's really the mitigation side. We also need to make sure that we work on\nadaptation and building resilience because there are many countries around the world\nthat are really not emitting, but they're feeling the impact of climate change. So, we need to remember that we need to finance\nthe comprehensive set of challenges. But what it also means is that we need to\ngive good policy advice.

Imagine if all of that, or even a portion\nof that, a share of that, was able to be put forward to dealing with climate change. We could really use that. But it also means that what we are doing is\nputting a renewed focus on the combination of public and private and partnerships with\nthe private sector, and I think this is so important. Srimathi Sridhar: I feel like I'd be remiss\nif I didn't ask you about the World Bank's Country Climate Development Reports. I know that they're a very important tool. Can you explain to the audience why? Why is it so important, as we kind of look\nat the climate crisis? Anna Bjerde: We have about 40 of them now,\nand what they do is look at two very important points for our clients.

And these reports actually show, with very\nrobust analytics that yes, absolutely you can. And in fact, for many countries, not addressing\nclimate change will cost, in terms of losses to GDP. But what they also do is identify priority\ninvestments. They identify how you can get there, what's\nthe path to decarbonization, and they also bring in that important issue that I brought\nin earlier, which is that it has to be inclusive and benefits for all.

One thing I haven't talked about yet, but\nI have discovered, and I'm so excited about our climate smart agricultural practices that\nI'm seeing. So, I've traveled recently to Sri Lanka and\nNepal, and I saw how smallholder farmers have been able to adapt their practices in agriculture\nto be able to adjust to the reality of climate change. And through very small interventions on technology,\ndoing things differently, they're able to protect their livelihood because they can\nprotect the yield of their production. It is livelihoods, it is often women, which\nI'm also passionate about, and it is climate in one go. So, this is also something that gives me hope. And finally, young people.

I'm really grateful. MIGA is very small as you know. We only have less than 200 people. The only way we can do this is really through\nthe collaboration. I think that's a unique mandate that MIGA\nhas. We do have a unique product through the guarantee\nprograms that we deploy, but still, we do need to have a wider community\nsupporting us.

We used in the first couple of cases, we did\nuse concessionality. But after that, we realized that the perception\nof risk was very different than the reality of risk. Then we stopped using concessionality. And the latest we have is that the private\nsector went in directly, even without us.

We were created by the US Congress to mobilize\ncapital to the private sector, to be a modernized development finance institution\nfor the United States. To answer your question about how climate\nfits into those priorities, one of the ideas behind the creation of DFC\nwas to broaden our tool set. Today, James and I, on behalf of our institution, signed agreements where each of our institutions\nare investing 15 million dollars of equity in a fantastic electric bike company operating\nthroughout South America called Tembici. Four years ago, before DFC existed and our\npredecessor was around, we would not have been able to do that. We didn't have the ability to make equity\ninvestments. That was key not only for making impact, but\nfor being a partner.

[Hilen Meirovich]\nIt's interesting. I think part of the conversation right now\nis we need different instruments, equity, blended finance or other guarantees,\nbut we also need a strategy.

And so, Julie, I wanted to ask you, having\nthe DFIs here, what would you ask us to do? Where do you see us moving forward with all\nthe changes that we have made in the last few years? [Julie Monaco]\nI'd like to join my friends in saying that this has been a long-term partnership with\nall of us. I don't think it's more\u2026 it's not what I need from the DFIs, it's what\nwe need to do together, because we've been partnering for a long time. I think what's been very evident is that scaling\nthe financing that's going to be needed will not be met by public funding, and it's\ngoing to have to be how do we scale the innovation that we have\ndone? I'm looking across this panel, and we've been partners for many, many decades\nbefore any of us were in these roles. We do innovative things together.",

I think that it really is around how we're\ngoing to mobilize that private capital at a scale. For us, what we think the changes that are\ngoing to need to be made is that we're going to have to come up with\nnew... we're going to need to change the existing\nproducts, the existing financial tools and products, and innovate in a way that's going to allow\nus to bring them to the capital markets. The only place that has enough money to close\nthese gaps that are in trillions of dollars is the capital\nmarkets. We have to collectively roll up our sleeves\nand be at a table and say, \u201cFor everything that we structure, the end\ngoal has to be how fast can we recycle that capital into\nthe capital markets?\u201d This year there's been a lot of discussions\nabout MDB reform.

But we do think that there are immediate things\nwe can be focusing on together that don't require the MDBs to ask for more\ncapital, and are not going to put the AAA rating at\nrisk. Those are the things that we... The immediate things we can do, I'll give\none specific example. As everyone knows, commercial banks being\nregulated the way we are, it is very difficult for us to take along\ntenors. We can't. The interpretation of Basel III, it's very punitive to our capital structure, so for renewable projects that are 20 to 25\nyears, it's just impossible for us to go into those\ntransactions. We see it as our role as a bank to be in those\ntransactions",

But we think that there's ways that we could\nbe working together, and IDB Invest has actually, I think, been\nan innovator in this, in that we need to do more mini-perms, so that commercial banks can come in with\nthe MDBs and the official money, and we put in pricing into those mini-perms\nthat when you're past the construction phase, the pricing starts getting more and more expensive, and it actually forces you into a refinancing. And we have to structure it from the beginning, knowing that we want to take it to the capital\nmarkets. There's also been a lot of discussion around\nsecuritization and recycling capital. An example I would use is I was on a panel\nyesterday for Indonesia for PLN. When you look at Indonesia and the 400 projects\nthey've laid out in their CIPP, you're talking about 156 billion dollars between\nnow and 2040. You've got JETP, which is about 21 billion\nof commitment. How many times do we have to recycle that\n20 billion to get to the 145?",

It's not even so much as what you need to\ndo, we can bring to the table if we are knowledgeable\non how to take any asset and securitize it. But it requires in the analysis we've been\ndoing of MDBs current loans, as well as government loans for infrastructure, they were never designed upfront to securitize\nthem. We need to go back to the drawing table together\nand say, \u201cHow do we innovate to be able to securitize?\u201d Then finally, this is something we need from\nour regulators desperately. We need a single interpretation of Basel III\nthat is consistent, because today there are different interpretations\nacross different jurisdictions, and at Citi we see that in spades because\nwe're operating in every jurisdiction.

[Hilen Meirovich]\nWhat OTHER lessons can you take from the experience that we've had with projects or that you had in DFC with projects that\ncan enhance this collaboration? [Scott Nathan]\nOne of the lessons that for sure we've taken is that we need a stable, enabling environment of laws and regulations in order to evaluate\nthese projects. We just recently did a loan for a solar deal\nin Ecuador, a 200-megawatt on-grid, first on grid solar deal in Ecuador end up\nproducing, we think, the cheapest electricity in the country.",

Other lessons are that we need to constantly\nbe pushing on innovation. Our work with philanthropic partners, with commercial advisors and banks and other\npartners like IDB and some of the Debt for Nature swaps we've\nbeen doing have meant that I think we're really creating\na whole new market in that. It addresses the enormous over indebtedness\nproblem that many of the countries where we operate\nface. But it's a use of our tool in a new and novel\nway, our political risk insurance way, the political risk insurance tool, to make sure that we can complete these transactions.

What are the challenges that you see in the\nregion and how can we close the infrastructure gap? [James Scriven]\nSo, a statistic that is important you need an ongoing at least 3% investment in physical infrastructure and digital infrastructure\nto be able to close the gap. Not by chance, we call ourselves an infrastructure\nbank. Most of our business, 70% of our activity\nis in the physical and digital infrastructure space. That was the reason for the partnership that\nwe've signed together, the MOU that we signed together is to move\ninto that space. I would say I would agree with Scott.

That's a unique comparative advantage because that combination of public and private\nis what makes the key. There's no difficult development solution\nthat is purely public or purely private.

In terms of the role that Citi needs to play\nin this, and as James was talking about having one\nsingle person that can oversee both the private sector and the public sector\nin the country and the power that that brings, I've seen that at Citi because I run public\nsector, so my team of bankers works with the public\nsector.

If we don't move them into emerging markets, they'll find space in the OECD countries. What we need to do as development institutions\nis make the decision of them just moving into the US and Europe to make\nit difficult by leveling the playing field of the emerging\nmarkets. What we do as a development organization or\ngroup is actually mitigate the risks that they're seeing. In many cases, the risk is of sovereign risk\ngrading, of changes of laws or expropriation. That's when institutions like MIGA have an\nenormous place to play. In other cases, there are other forms of risk. But a colleague of mine once said, if it's not the multilaterals, who will it\nbe?",

I do think the cry for MDB reforms, and I'm looking at Hans that had a big role\nto play in this, is now. That's why our obsession in what we call an\nevolution of the IDB Invest is to move away from being an investor to\nbeing a catalyzer. This concept of originate to share is no longer\na concept of a buy and hold model for us because anything that we keep in our balance\nsheet is something that could be financed by somebody else, by\nus taking more risk. I think the biggest impediment to development\nfinance through the MDB role is many people talk about\nleverage. For me, it's not leverage. For me, it's our risk appetite framework that\nis outdated and probably obsolete at this point in time. I think that's the evolution. I've been coined as troublemaker in this COP. For me, the word obsolete comes to mind because\nI think we need to evolve.",

I had a nice discussion with some of our private\nsector partners yesterday, but it's an amazing transformation over there\nsince Paris that the sustainability has become mainstream\nfor the private sector. Now because of that, we need to go one step\nbeyond them, I guess. There's an obligation that we need that uniquely that the MDBs or the DFIs can do is really\nset the standards.

That risk mitigation tools we have, political\nrisk insurance like what MIGA has, DFC has been in\u2026 the United States, has\nbeen in that business since the Marshall Plan. That's incredibly important. But the combination of capital provision and\nrisk mitigation, I think, together work incredibly powerfully. And innovation has got to be part of that.

What are your strengths and constraints? And come together and do this innovation to\nunlock that institutional capital. I think we're taking the right steps.

That's complex because you're talking about\nrestructuring a country's debt while you're trying to get development projects\ndone.

You should know that the World Bank will be\nby your side during the recovery and the reconstruction. At its founding, the International Development\nAssociation was charged with a simple yet noble mission to raise standards of living and build momentum\nfor growth in developing countries. The landscape we face today is far more complex. We have declining progress in our fight against\npoverty. We have an existential climate crisis. We have food insecurity, fragility, a fledgling\npandemic recovery and conflict that touches lives well beyond\nthe front lines. This is a perfect storm of intertwined challenges\nthat actually exacerbate inequality. Meanwhile, in the next ten years, 1.1 billion\nyoung people across the global south will become working-age adults. In that same period, and in the same countries, we are only expected to create 325 million\njobs. The cost of inaction is unimaginable in those\nhundreds of millions of young people's hopes,",

How can we hope to make even adequate progress with this 600 million people in Africa, 36\nmillion of whom are here in Tanzania, who still don't have access to reliable electrical\nconnections and supply? Put simply, we cannot. Without electricity, there is no social, no\neconomic development. To confront these intertwined development\nchallenges, our only option is to respond aggressively,\nsimultaneously and comprehensively. That is why we have adopted a new vision at\nthe Bank to create a world free of poverty on a livable\nplanet. With this vision, what we are trying to do\nis to widen the aperture of the World Bank and our people, and at the same time get the demand, get the\nmotivation to demand that we expand the scope of IDA.

We need to move beyond projects to platforms. We need to replicate and scale success. We need to steal shamelessly and share seamlessly. For example, not too long ago, I visited a town in Nigeria where IDA had\nhelped fund a mini grid system. The electricity it generated allowed small\nfarmers to do their work in half the time. It enabled shopkeepers to accept digital payments and gave diabetics regular access to climate-controlled\ninsulin.

We need everyone, donors, shareholders, philanthropies\nto step up, join us, and bring their ambition to the fight. Otherwise, the potential for IDA will never\nbe realized. But the change we aspire to achieve cannot\njust be bought. We must reform to be faster and more efficient. We must make good on the World Bank's evolution\nroadmap and make IDA more approachable, accessible\nand understandable. We have to keep focus on our goal to be better\npartners and deliver more impact outcomes. That is more difficult when we require the\ngovernments we serve, who often have limited capacity, to navigate\nan opaque web of bespoke funds, each with a unique application process, individual\nstandards and variable allocations. This overwhelms countries, it makes planning\ndifficult. It drives attention away from impact and outcomes. Ultimately, development delayed is development\ndenied. If we could create fewer funds with more flexibility,\nstreamline standards, or bring uniformity to the application process,\nwe can give back time.

As it stands, the poverty level in the region\nremains alarmingly high, hovering at 37.6% in 2023. Furthermore, the number of people living in\ndeprivation has also increased. Distinguished delegates, I would like to recognize\nIDA's model of efficiency, which minimizes transaction costs through\nthe scale, concession and predictability of its financing\nand leveraging on each dollar of donor contribution. As such, our plea to the World Bank Group\nand partners is to strengthen support to better ensure IDA countries achieve the\nSustainable Development Goals. As we roll out the African Continental Free\nTrade Area to enhance competitiveness and job creation\nthrough regional integration and trade, we believe IDA and IFC need to increase support\nto foster a thriving private sector. Central to this is integrating African business\ninto global value chains and attracting FDIs. This approach demands a blend of finance and\nrisk mitigation, particularly crucial for derisking investments\nin IDA economies. To this end, we are convinced that the private\nsector window",

For instance, during the COP28 in Dubai, Tanzania spearheaded the launch of the African\nWomen Clean Cooking Support Program, a gender responsive energy transition approach\nin Africa. The program seeks to empower women across\nAfrica through the transition to clean fuels and\ntechnologies. It will also help us reduce emissions and\nreduce use of biomass fuels which impact on our environment.

I've seen you in many different [unintelligible]. But the one that strikes me always is the\none that brings out the best in you is the advocacy for development, so thank\nyou. My issue with the intertwined challenges is\nvery simple. I believe that the idea of segregating the\nfight on poverty and sharing prosperity, essentially the idea of fighting inequality\ncannot be taken separately from the challenges of nature and climate,\nfrom the challenges of fragility, conflict and violence, from the challenges of food insecurity, or\nfrom any of these issues, like pandemics.",

They are all intertwined. I've said this many times, but having grown up in India and having been\na part of what now is called, unfortunately, the Global South, a term that I don't like,\nbut let's say the emerging or developing world, is that when you rely on rainfall for agriculture, and if you get two to three crops in a year\nbecause of abundant rain, the moment you have three to four years, like\nin Kenya right now, it's the fifth year of low rainfall. Basically, what that means is a farmer with\ntwo crops is down to one. If you're down to one, you no longer can afford\nthe cattle. That dairy income goes off. You no longer have the farming labor, and\nyou get your children out of school. Typically, you start with your girl child.

But the reality is we cannot afford the same\nkind of emissions-heavy growth that we've already been through. The air is fungible. We're all breathing it. It's a shared planet.

[Ajay Banga]\nI don't think you can ever tell a donor country that you shouldn't be concerned about your\ndomestic populations. That would be far from what I'm saying. What I am saying is that if you give a dollar\nto IDA, every dollar you give ends up being four in\nthe case of IDA's outlays. That is a multiplier factor that is very,\nvery unique and very helpful.

I think those two factors put together make\nIDA quite unique. I will tell you, while you were talking about\ndebt for a minute, in the G20 Common Framework on Debt, four countries volunteered to come into it\nto have their debt addressed. Now, it's taken a lot of time for them to\ncome through the pipe, and the first country took the longest, the second one's a little better. It's still too long.

But if I may, Ajay, this room represents in\nsome ways the most interesting development coalition\nthere is out there, because you've got, I think it's 74 IDA borrowing, grant-receiving\ncountries. But now you've got 58 donor countries, including a number who are themselves ex-IDA\nbeneficiaries.

Let me step back for a second and talk about\ntwo different things. We are on the continent of Africa where 70%\nof IDA money goes. The reality is, while there are challenges\nin Latin America and Asia, a number of those countries have developed\nand grown over the years. Africa is still the continent where a lot\nof this effort has been put in. I speak of Africa with great respect because\nI've been coming here for a long time and I believe that Africa's young population,\ncombined with rich mineral resources, sun, water, air, arable land, you know, the\nwhole, everybody talks about that story. It's here. The thing is those young people must have\nquality of life when they're growing up.",

[Mark Malloch-Brown]\nI'm sure everybody in the room would concur with that. Let me press you a bit, Ajay, on how IDA works. I mean, we're getting towards IDA21. It is a sort of feature of development finance\nnow over many, many years. I'm old enough to remember early IDAs, and\nin a way it's like our favorite aunt. We take it for granted and it's a familiar\nfeature of the family. But I think it's time that we give the aunt\nsome high heels and some new clothes, actually. The reason I say that we talk about the debt\nsituation in Africa. Let me just take the case of Tanzania's neighbor\nKenya. Kenya now has a debt problem, but at a critical\nmoment like Ghana, because of access to the Eurobond market, it preferred to borrow money at three times\nthe points and a much steeper repayment period from Eurobonds than it did from IDA.",

The reason it got that money quickly, it didn't have heavy conditionality. It responded to the government's immediate\ndemocratic needs within the lifetime of that democratic government\nbefore it faced elections again. One of the frustrations many have with IDA\nis its relative slowness from project to disbursement. A second, if I may, I think difficulty has\nbeen the sort of projectization of a lot of what it does, rather than working with countries on their\nprogram and their leadership of the program. I know that IDA's team really want to change\nthat. A third problem is perhaps around the allocation, where it's kind of easy and safer to give\nit to the countries with strong governance. Yet increasingly you've got fragile and failing\nstates. That clearly is going to be a central part\nof IDA21 and how you operate in that environment. My point really is I think there's some refashioning,\nrelaunching, reengineering issues, which I'm sure will get brought up in these\ntwo days discussion. But I wonder whether you could sort of give\na sense of your views about those issues.",

My point really is I think there's some refashioning,\nrelaunching, reengineering issues, which I'm sure will get brought up in these\ntwo days discussion. But I wonder whether you could sort of give\na sense of your views about those issues. [Ajay Banga]\nI kind of mentioned this in my opening remarks, but as an outsider coming in some months ago\ninto the Bank, what surprised me was the multiplicity of\nthings we were trying to measure ourselves to, and the unfortunate part that most of those\nwere inputs rather than outcomes. At the World Bank level as a whole, our corporate\nscorecard has 150 something items. We've ended up that way for good intentions. Donor countries, donors have said, this is\nimportant for me, and I need to have this measure. \u201cThis is important for me.\u201d I understand the logic. The problem is, at the end of the day, we've ended up with a complex web which creates\nthe slowness of getting things through and the different challenges for transparency\nand understanding of how to get access to those funds by anybody\noutside of the community. That is not our friend, that is our enemy\nin this kind of a fight.",

That is not our friend, that is our enemy\nin this kind of a fight. If these countries had the capacity to deal\nwith the complexity that we are creating for them, they would probably not be in the situation\nthey are. I think we have to step back a little bit,\nstruggle with this issue. It's not going to be easy, but struggle with\nit and find ways to simplify what we are trying to do to make it easier\nand more transparent. Nobody, no one can find a way to be successful\nwhen you're measured at 153 different inputs. It is not possible. By the way, it also dilutes the ability to\nhold people to task, because with 153, I'm talking about the World Bank level, at\nthe IDA level, it's 1000. At the World Bank level, it's 153. No one can be held to task with 153. In my prior private sector life, we used to\njoke that if I give you so many objectives, you will always be successful because you\nwill find at least 20, 30 of them where you've done well.

Some of our processes, some of our ways of\ndealing with the kinds of things we are trying to do, have to change and evolve to the concept that\nspeed is of the essence. Across the Bank as a whole, it takes us 27\nmonths from the time to start conceiving a product for the first dollar to go out. Some of that we can fix. Some of that we have to work with countries\nand their systems to fix. But the answer of 27 months is the wrong answer. It's just not okay.

It's a moment when you've put it out there,\nyou're pinned to it forever. Anything less isn't a success. I'm sure it's premature in that sense to show\nthat card, to show a number. But I think what we can say is this IDA is\ndifferent from the last couple of IDAs, by which I mean IDA21 because the acceleration of IDA 20, the ambition\nit had 19 and 20 over the COVID-19 period and the beginning of the polycrises period\nmeans that there's no way around it. IDA21 has to have increased donor resources. The Bank simply can't stretch the arithmetic\nto do it on its own. It's maybe been its own worst enemy by being\ntoo successful in getting that four to one leverage or three\nto one, because now it really is time for the donors to step up.

Let's remember that we all thought that by\n2030 we would have solved the world's problems. We also should remember we're not going to\ndo it. That is clear. That concept of 2030 was inbuilt in the way\nwe were allowing the discretionary capital in IDA to run down. But guess what? It's time to realize that's not happening. If we want this to continue, in a way, this is the time as well to rethink that trajectory. We've actually got two challenges. It's the challenge of keeping the volume scale\ngrant concessionality framework of IDA at the level of being able to compete with\nthe perfect storm of challenges that we spoke about at the beginning.",

Then there's the issue that we had factored\nin some kind of thinking about when the world would be in a better\nplace. The reality is, if anything, the world's complexities\nhave taken us in the wrong direction. The G20 Expert Framework laid out a number\nthat said we should triple the size of IDA. I think that is interesting and useful. I don't think that's a practical thing to\nexpect given the competing demands on everyone's\nfiscal headroom. However, the fact is that IDA funding from\ndonor countries has gone down or been flat for the last 20\nyears. The only reason IDA looks bigger than it did\n20 years ago is because of that four to one leverage. That is reaching the limits of its creativity. One needs to keep in mind, therefore, that just coming back to the level of prior\nIDAs has many challenges, including leveragability, but also the issue\nof the decline that we were seeing, the 2030 idea.",

It's something that must come from within\nour country to develop. We need the support of other people. If we do not change, we cannot meet the goals\nthat we have set. As the President of the World Bank said, I hope that all of us are going to work together\nin partnership so that we can solve it. I think the emergency and the velocity and\nthe governance must be better. We have to base result on this approach and\nthe specificity of countries. Thank you very much. [Victoria Kwakwa]\nThank you very much, Vice Prime Minister. What I heard you say is that as African governments, partners and central to IDA, you need to bring\nin even better governance, strong governance in the partnership and in\nyour implementation of the support of IDA. And bring in a sense of urgency, speed and\nall of us work in a partnership that considers scale and results in our work.",

We were blessed at the African Union Commission\nto host the President, which I think was one of the first trips he\nmade outside World Bank headquarters after assuming office. It was indeed a very strong signal. The chairperson of the African Union Commission, his Excellency Moussa Faki Mahamat, welcomed\nhim and his delegation and the meeting was focusing on opportunities\nto strengthen the partnership, keyword being partnership. I like it so much. Of course, we already have a strong partnership\nwith the World Bank, which now has grown tenfold over the last\nten years to 250 million and ranging from areas such as regional integration, agriculture and food resilience systems support\nthe implementation of the statistics strategy for the continent,\nfor instance.

Digital transformation, connectivity, that's\nwhat we need, electricity to be implemented. We need also our public institutions to be\nmore responsive, more well governed and responsive to the citizens\u2019 needs. We need issues of Africa resolving its conflict\nmore amicably, the nexus between security, peace, development,\nenvironment. We want to tighten it even more and see results\nfrom the ground. In this second Ten Year Implementation Plan, we needed to touch on issues of our culture\nas our identities as a country, our creative industry, how are we harnessing\ndiaspora and the people of African descent? We need also to see more citizens empowered\nand resourced, including access to education, health care,\nissues of inclusion for women, youths, disabled and other demographics, issues of\nskill development for residents.

At the outset, let me join all of you in expressing\nour condolences for Tanzanian government and people for the loss caused by the natural\ndisaster. You raised an excellent question and I have\na very simple answer for that. We basically support IDA for three reasons. Number one, we fully support the financial\nresources of IDA.

Number two, you have the knowledge and the\nbrains. Talking to a lot of IDA colleagues, we see a deep expertise in providing high\nquality infrastructure investments. You have more colleagues on the ground dealing\nwith locals, understanding their needs. I think the Minister raised a lot of excellent\nand super inclusive comments on the basic needs of water, electricity,\nenergy, clean cooking and the list goes on. having the World Bank colleagues on the ground\ninteracting with governments and locals is very unique and this is very inclusive.

Don't take my word, you have a good track record of countries\nthat used to be recipients and now they are a donor. This is a real success story that we see value. When we look at the Kingdom, the Kingdom of\nSaudi Arabia is a long-standing supporter to the World Bank and other NDBs. We are by far the largest Arab donor as well as in the MENA region we provide a\nlot of support. We are considered to be agile for countries\naffected by conflicts, natural disasters and other humanitarian crises. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will be always\nin the forefront of support.

I would like just to conclude with one example\nfrom the creditor point of view, and I think this is very important, and other\nspeakers have mentioned this. A lot of countries during crisis, including\nthe COVID-19 crisis, they have faced constrained fiscal space. They have competing internal priorities. But in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, if you\nlook at the Kingdom during the COVID-19 crisis, we more than doubled our support to the foreign\naid.

But I think to step back to the wider dimension\nof this and to the phrase I used in conversation earlier\nwith President Banga. There is this issue of taking IDA from being\nthis sort of private instrument of the World Bank and its donors to making it that universal\ninstrument, that vehicle for achieving the SDGs and global\ndevelopment ambitions.

As the Minister mentioned, creating high-quality\njobs, creating high-resilient infrastructure. As a donor, we hope to see and we are confident\nthat the Bank will go from a very good institution to an excellent institution in being a provider\nof development. When it comes to cooperation, we have maybe\nthree priorities. Given the rising debt issues in a lot of countries,\nespecially in this region, when you see a big portion of the fiscal budget\ngoes to paying interest and paying debt payments, while you have competing social priorities, health care, education and social protection\nis really very weak. We hope to see more support from the Bank\nand the membership in terms of cooperating under the Common Framework. I think we heard the President Ajay has mentioned\nthis in his opening remark. We commend the Bank for the work it has provided for the four countries who applied for the\nCommon Framework. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is a co-chair\nwith France, the Paris Club and with the support from China and India\nthat we succeeded.",

Number two, on climate change, we have seen\nthe recent announcement by the Bank in the COP 28 to provide 40 billion support\nfor climate change. This is indeed very commendable. We would like to see more country specific\ncircumstances are reflected. I think the Minister has mentioned it. Island countries and small state countries have contributed nothing to climate change,\nbut they are bearing the most cost of climate change. We need the Bank to pay more attention to\nadaptation, to build high-quality infrastructure, more climate-resilient infrastructure, and\nnot to put more emphasis on mitigation policies that are more suited to the countries who\ncontributed a lot to the climate shock.

We have seen endorsements by all of the G20\nmembers to this Framework, and we are keen to see the World Bank adopting\nsuch Framework because it's very inclusive, it is very specific to each country's circumstances, and it takes into account the emissions that\nwe need to tackle, not the sources of the emissions. I think this is a recipe of success. Finally, and I think Mark has mentioned this\non the localization. You rightly mentioned a very important topic\nfor a lot of countries. When you see high quality jobs, you cannot have growth that is not driven\nby localization and integration to the global economy. I think the World Bank could do more in terms\nof enhancing localization within the country, but then enhance regional trade, given that\na lot of countries in the region and around this place,",

We can just put aside any sort of lingering\nbelief that this is a business-as-usual moment. As Ajay told us today, this is a moment of\nprofound crises in all our societies, of the polycrises, of the perfect storm. Call it what you will.

By not acknowledging that during the COVID-19\nperiod you guys did crowd in, you reduced the period of funding and yet\nlocked in at that high annual amount.

You can't have a successful COP without a\nsuccessful IDA. It's what holds the whole thing together. IDA as a development financing tool, but IDA\nalso as a climate adaptation financing tool. Third, and to the World Bank leadership, I would say you've rightly gotten a lot of\npraise from this stage today, but don't forget, there's a huge obligation\non you also to make IDA more user friendly, more consumer friendly, better locally owned. That, I think, is two things. It's finding mechanisms to be much quicker,\nas Ajay acknowledged, in the speed with which loans are agreed and\ndisbursed, and grants, obviously, too. Secondly, to really move to this more programmatic,\nlocally-owned strategic model from still what is a little bit of a project\nby project-based model.

        "excerpt": "Meet Angelique Ayinkamiye, a nursery school teacher in the\nGasabo district of Kigali city, Rwanda. My personal development has improved significantly since I started\nreceiving government salaries on May 1st. We have improved our knowledge and working methods, We are now able to afford a decent living for ourselves and our families. Angelique saw this transformation as part of an initiative to\nnurture and build the country\u2019s human capital. Specifically, through increased support and management of teachers. While starting out, it was challenging as there were few teachers. Today, we are grateful that there are many pre-primary teachers. Children are fed at school and on time. Even parents in vulnerable situations know that if their child is at school and the government is taking\ncare of them, things will go well. These wide-reaching results are thanks to\nthe effort led by the Rwandan government, with support from the World Bank\u2019s International Development Association, or IDA and other partners. On education, we\u2019ve made real strides in access and including, because of the World Bank\u2019s investment\nin classrooms and teachers and we\u2019re now really pulling together on how we also improve the quality of that education to deliver the outcomes we want. Human capital is the knowledge, skills, and health that\npeople accumulate throughout their lives. Developing a country\u2019s human capital is important to reduce extreme poverty and create more inclusive societies. That\u2019s why the Government of Rwanda has worked\nacross ministries and stakeholders to deliver better and more efficient social protection, nutrition, health, and education services to the people of Rwanda.",

Supported by development policy financing from the World Bank\u2019s International Development Association, the government set its sights on both addressing immediate needs and putting in place robust systems for the future. The project is already delivering transformational results across the human lifecycle. More newborns are registered with the government\nwithin 30 days of birth, allowing them better access to key services. Educational reforms prepared the country to better respond to shocks\u2014 for example, almost all primary school children\nreturned to school after COVID-19 closures. Drastic improvements in teacher management pave the way for better student learning and improved teacher career pathways. Access to health services increased for the poorest people. Emergency cash transfers are made available to largely female-headed households affected by the recent pandemic, And a dynamic new social registry to identify and help the most vulnerable people. These are just some of the outcomes of this sweeping effort. Amid many challenges, investing in the people of Rwanda remains a sure path to ending poverty on our planet. The World Bank\u2019s IDA remains committed to ensuring\nno one is left behind on that journey.",

We're for the panel to discuss how do we\u00a0\nscale up global clean hydrogen financing. This is a really hot subject which\u00a0\nis getting warmer every time. I think we're going to have a great conversation. My name is Demetrios Papathanasiou. I'm the World Bank's Global\u00a0\nDirector for Energy and Extractives. Today, we have a really very good panel from private and public sector\u00a0\nstakeholders in this field. My colleague from the IFC, Bertrand de la\u00a0\nBorde, is going to introduce them afterwards. Interest in clean hydrogen has\u00a0\nbeen around for quite some time, but in the last two, three years, we\u00a0\nsee interest growing exponentially. What is really fascinating\u00a0\nfor us is that this presents a great opportunity for\u00a0\ndeveloping countries as well. We will discuss why this is so. We work with governments on\u00a0\nhow we can decide policies, how we can improve the regulatory framework so that the offtake of clean\u00a0\nhydrogen can be addressed as well. As many of you know, as we try\u00a0\nto transform the world's system from the current fossil\u00a0\nfuels towards clean hydrogen,",

As many of you know, as we try\u00a0\nto transform the world's system from the current fossil\u00a0\nfuels towards clean hydrogen, we really have a chicken and egg problem. There's not enough supply of clean hydrogen, and because there's not enough supply, people don't invest in the devices\u00a0\nthat can use clean hydrogen, and then we can really get things going. We need to be working both, on the\u00a0\nsupply side and the demand side. We are doing a little bit on that. At the World Bank, we have approved\u00a0\nin just this last calendar year, a total of 1.65 billion dollars to\u00a0\npromote hydrogen around the world. The even better news is that\u00a0\nmore is under preparation. We're taking this seriously. We're financing it, and we believe\u00a0\nthat it is one of the good ways to take the energy transition globally forward. IFC is already engaged and\u00a0\ndiscussed with various sponsors in 10 green hydrogen projects globally, and the estimate of the investment\u00a0\nis roughly about 10 billion.",

This is important and it is significant,\u00a0\nand we're very serious about it. Now, the reality, again, is that there's a\u00a0\nhuge number of announcements of projects, but we still see very few of them\u00a0\ncoming in the final investment decision. There are issues to be sorted out. Some of them are policy issues,\u00a0\nsome of them are regulatory. And the other big issue, of course,\u00a0\nis that at the moment, clean hydrogen is about three times more expensive compared\u00a0\nto the alternative that comes from gas. So, how can we bridge the gap? What is it that can be done? So just ahead of this COP28, we issued\u00a0\na report trying to answer the question, and it is called \u201cScaling Hydrogen\u00a0\nFinancing for Development.\u201d If you Google that, it will pop out and it has a\u00a0\nquite brisk pace of downloads from our website.

What we're really proposing there is\u00a0\nanalysis of why is this not happening, and then an action agenda. We propose four key items. First of all, we commit to work and\u00a0\nget done 10 gigawatts of clean hydrogen at the electrolyzer space and we want\u00a0\nto do this in emerging markets by 2030. The goal is to try and find projects between\u00a0\n100 megawatts to 1,000 megawatts in size from the existing project pipeline and support them from announcement\u00a0\nto feasibility studies all the way to final investment decision. Ultimately, we believe that what happened\u00a0\nin most of clean energy technologies will happen for electrolyzers\u00a0\nand for clean hydrogen, and we will see it becoming\u00a0\nmore and more competitive and we need that for the clean energy transition. The second part of what we do\u00a0\nis create the enabling policies, the regulatory environment, and the institutions\u00a0\nthat can help with moving this agenda forward. This includes promoting a global digital\u00a0\nplatform where we can exchange information on best practices and bringing more\u00a0\nfinancial resources for technical assistance.

With this, I will turn it over to Bertrand\u00a0\nso that we go to the panel discussion. But I will close by saying that we\u00a0\nare serious about clean hydrogen.

[Vineet Mittal]\u00a0 The main challenge we are facing is\u00a0\nthat most of the port infrastructure in India did not even have a grid\u00a0\nconnectivity of the magnitude which you need.

Why should India even participate\u00a0\nin that whole value chain when we are still subsidizing\u00a0\nour fertilizer sector? A lot of our time even today goes in\u00a0\neducating our policymakers at federal level, at provincial level, because\u00a0\nit's a very new topic. There is lack of awareness, there\u00a0\nis lack of knowledge about it.

I will just build on that to say that\u00a0\nI think that the two main challenges that we are facing is, first\u00a0\nof all, cost competitiveness. We need to make the business case\u00a0\nfor green hydrogen and green ammonia, and the cost is key for that. The fact also that the market\u00a0\nis still unpredictable.

The second leverage for me is the\u00a0\ncarbon pricing mechanisms in general. We see today the CBAM coming, the\u00a0\nCarbon Border Adjustments Mechanism, and this is the kind of incentives that could\u00a0\nmake the business case of green hydrogen and green ammonia, for sure. Absolutely necessary also to work on\u00a0\nthe production costs to make them down. It's very important. To bring the production cost down, it's important to work on the\u00a0\noverall efficiency of the system, how to integrate renewable with\u00a0\nbatteries, to deal with the intermittency, to deal with new technologies of\u00a0\nelectrolyzers that are today promising.

Integrating locally the ecosystem is also\u00a0\nhelping to provide the needed capacity, but also to bring the costs down. It's very important. About the fact that the markets\u00a0\nare still unpredictable, at OCP we are following very\u00a0\nclosely the market movements and how many players are stepping\u00a0\nin to commit to new projects on green hydrogen and green ammonia.

Currently, I have won a project of 1,400 megawatt in a reverse auction process at 3.5 cents tariff. The cost is almost like 11, 12% of what it\u00a0\nused to be and in less than 13 years period. That's a challenge. That's an opportunity because\u00a0\nthe early buyers are saying, \u201cWhy should we be the first one\u00a0\nto sign the offtake agreement if the cost curve is already\u00a0\nclear that it is going to go\u00a0\u00a0 down and people are looking at support?\u201d What we are seeing is that the way Japan, METI has announced the initial plan of 100\u00a0\nbillion dollar or 106 billion dollar contract for difference with very\u00a0\nclearly articulated matrix",

If this industry has to succeed,\u00a0\u00a0 you can't be putting in pressure from\u00a0\nday one on a dollar hydrogen cost. Otherwise, it will not take off. I think you have to let it first mature,\u00a0\u00a0 stabilize, and then think\u00a0\nof making it most optimal. That's the exact thing which happened in\u00a0\nsolar and wind sector when many countries in Europe in 2010 and 2011 started\u00a0\nsigning 10 gigawatt, 15 gigawatt projects. That's when the whole supply chain became\u00a0\ntoo big and entrepreneurs started realizing that it's a real opportunity. Same thing we are seeing in the hydrogen\u00a0\nspace that there is a lot of excitement. There is a lot of capital which is also available, we raised 1.3 billion for our\u00a0\nfirst million ton project. But the challenge is the pressure. The pressure from everyone is\u00a0\nso big on cost bringing down. Whereas the pressure should be on institutions",

Whereas the pressure should be on institutions like World Bank, ADBs, KfWs, and companies like\u00a0\nHintco to actually create that marketplace. Say, for example, if Hintco is saying\u00a0\na billion dollar CfD, it's peanuts. See, today it's a real fact\u00a0\nthat it's a double the price. If you look at CBAM or ETS, it's\u00a0\nonly solving for at even 100 euro. At ammonia, they are going to\u00a0\nsubsidize by 280 US dollar return. The challenge is that the\u00a0\nCBAM alone won't serve it. I think there is a need to sign and agree\u00a0\nthat there are multilateral agencies which can facilitate larger\u00a0\nadoption of green ammonia. How to do it is actually through Article 6,\u00a0\nwhich was signed in the COPs Agreement in Paris. [Bertrand de la Borde]\nClearly, Susana,\u00a0\u00a0 the board is coming in your direction\u00a0\non this, how to support offtake. It was a chicken and egg problem of Demetrios. How do you handle that?

We are currently in the process\u00a0\nof conducting the auction. And since it's the first, it's having some\u00a0\ninitial, let's say, delays associated with it. So, we have had to extend it already three times. And the main issue is because\u00a0\nthe projects weren't ready and it's a lot of information\u00a0\nthat needs to happen. They need to mobilize. One of the issues, for example, is because\u00a0\nthis particular auction needs to comply with all the EU regulations, and REDD+, and etc. What is happening is some of the\u00a0\nprojects are having difficulties in even understanding all of these requirements and how they can translate\u00a0\nit into the actual projects.

The other one that is also really important\u00a0\nand you mentioned it as well, is the size. Of course, 900 million euros sounds\u00a0\nlike a very significant amount of money and it is a lot of money. But if you then divide it by three different\u00a0\nhydrogen products over 10-year period, actually the quantities are not very significant. That means that for certain\u00a0\nprojects that are large scale, they cannot become viable with\u00a0\njust that specific contract. They need more projects.

In terms of the way we are structured, we\u00a0\nreally see ourselves as a market maker. It's a different approach\u00a0\nwhere we have the intermediary that has access to funds from government that\u00a0\nhelp compensate for the cost of difference. But it's not, let's say, a single auction. There's not a point-to-point contract. It's a very different approach. Our understanding from talking\u00a0\nto the Japanese government, because they've also expressed\u00a0\ninterest in the H2Global approach, is that they will start with contracts\u00a0\nfor difference, as you were mentioning, but they are interested in\u00a0\nlooking at this type of approach as well to help deal with some of the issues. I think the main advantage, I guess, of\u00a0\nthis type of approach is on one hand, you promote competition because you\u00a0\nare having auctions on both sides. The other is because of that and the difference\u00a0\nin times between the initial contracts, which were 10 years, and then the\u00a0\ncontracts from the buyer side of one year, you get the possibility as prices evolve that you\u00a0\ndon't have to compensate so much for the price.",

[Vineet Mittal]\nI think where Japan,\u00a0\u00a0 Korea, and Singapore are unique\u00a0\nis their use of Article 6. What they are saying under\u00a0\nthe Joint Crediting Mechanism, the countries which are willing to share their\u00a0\nITMO with Japan would get credit for that. That actually is the spirit of\u00a0\nthe COPs that the Global South should get an opportunity to participate\u00a0\nin the green hydrogen transition. They don't have those deep pockets like US\u2019\u00a0\nIRA or Japan's 106 billion dollar support or Korea's contract for different\u00a0\nsupport and Europe's support for CfD. Those country needs someone to enable\u00a0\nthem so that projects come there initially for the global market, and then they will\u00a0\nstart adopting in their local market. It is very essential to look at that only by decarbonizing Europe and Japan\u00a0\nand Korea won't solve the problem.

By motivating them to build the projects in their\u00a0\ncountry, give them the entire carbon benefits, as well as they offtake the 100%\u00a0\nquantum as long as it's competitive. It actually solved similar to ENCO, but\u00a0\nwith a different incentive also aligned. [Bertrand de la Borde]\nThank you very much. Perhaps it's time to move to Chile. Chile has been a front runner in that space. Combination of tremendous potential in renewable\u00a0\nenergy, wind and solar, as we all know, and also very proactive and deliberate policy from the government and Euro-organism, CORFO, which the World Bank is supporting\u00a0\nthrough 150 million loan.

[Ana Maria Ruz]\nOn 2021,\u00a0\u00a0 we called for financing the first large\u00a0\nindustrial scale green hydrogen plant in Chile with a subsidy of 50 million dollars. At that time, we asked for companies with\u00a0\nmore than 25 millions of annual income, and international risk less than BBB minus. Ten proposals arrived. Now, CORFO have contracts\u00a0\nsigned with five projects and we were very happy at that time because\u00a0\nthe projects are regionally distributed. Also, some of the projects\u00a0\nare local for domestic demand in order for exporting metanol or ammonia. And, what happens now as a reimbursement\u00a0\nscheme, this year, now, December 2023, is key because if they don't\u00a0\nhave to see the stage now, probably they are not getting the step\u00a0\nof commissioning by December 2025.

Actually, the cost of the energy and\u00a0\nalso the cost of connection to the grid, that is very important. When they applied on 2021, the cost of connection\u00a0\nto the grid, it was close to 5, 10 dollars. Actually, it's more than 20\u00a0\ndollars per megawatt hour. What is happening is the increasing quantity\u00a0\nof renewal that we have in our matrix and the decarbonization plan that we have, the complementary service that is\u00a0\nrequired for the grid has increased more than 20, 25 dollars per megawatt hour. The projects now cannot get the fifth stage because they have a really\u00a0\nlarge cost of the electricity. We need really to think out of the\u00a0\nbox and the other in looking for ideas in order to help those projects. All these projects are not so large.

They don't have now the freedom of having\u00a0\na bidding about the cost of electricity, about the electricity that they\u00a0\ncould need for the project.

They treat it as an extension\u00a0\nof the Green Energy Project, which were backed by the long-term\u00a0\npower purchase agreement. Similar arrangement they are seeking\u00a0\nat least for 15 to 20 years on this. And if that is not happening, not\u00a0\neveryone is fortunate like her who can do an offtake agreement with\u00a0\nthe fertilizer company of a group. That's a non-recourse. From the perspective of\u00a0\nIndian banks and institutions, they are looking at otherwise corporate\u00a0\nguarantees, etc., because they are currently... It's coming again from the lack of knowledge\u00a0\nthat no one has seen the CBAM continuous, no one is aware of that how the ETS is staying\u00a0\nat 79 to 82 dollars or touching 100 dollars. What will be response of Europe on that? Initially, Japan also started talking\u00a0\nabout blue, green, and everything else. Today, because of so many colors of hydrogen\u00a0\nand with pink being signed here in this COP, I think it has created a further complexity.",

So, you'd use the IRA to create the local\u00a0\nmarket for green ammonia, green methanol. Let that not be exported so that\u00a0\nthere is a level playing field between the different producers in the world. I think, second thing is creating\u00a0\na global platform for offtake. Even if you do it for 10 years\u00a0\nfor 20 million, believe me, when we will be sitting two years down\u00a0\nthe line when you have created that, there will be a supplier-side\u00a0\nchallenge, not the buyer-side challenge.

For sure, substituting gray\u00a0\nammonia that we import today; but also, we have an overall objective\u00a0\nof being carbon neutral by 2040 and this means that we need to\u00a0\ndecarbonize all our core industry. We use a lot of fossil fuels today\u00a0\nto dry phosphate in the mining,\u00a0\u00a0 for mining mobility and so on. We consider hydrogen a key lever to achieve\u00a0\ndecarbonization of our core activities today and then get into this carbon\u00a0\nneutrality target by 2040. Green hydrogen can be used to dry phosphate or to dry even other minerals to substitute\u00a0\nfossil fuels in these operations. Also, for green mobility, for heavy\u00a0\ntracks in the mining, for sure. there is a balance between some new\u00a0\ntransportation, like hydraulic transportation, let's say, electric transportation\u00a0\ninstead of mining trucks.

There are a lot of opportunities. Also, what comes to my mind is that\u00a0\nfor these kinds of utilizations, the business case is already there. You need in some cases, using solar\u00a0\nenergy to dry is less expensive than using fossil fuels in furnaces. Sometimes, we have some already made ideas that we need also to train and to bring\u00a0\nand to experience before being sure that the way that we already did it before is not\u00a0\nnecessarily the best way that we can use today.

[Ana Maria Ruz]\nFrom our side,\u00a0\u00a0 all the projects that are\u00a0\ndomestic-demand are very important because as I said before, not just\u00a0\nexporting green hydrogen or green ammonia or e-methane or e-gasoline, also to export\u00a0\ngreen steel, green glass, green copper are very important for us, creating more\u00a0\njobs in our country and increasing our GDP.

I don't want to be kind, I'm\u00a0\njust telling what I think. The World Bank is an outstanding\u00a0\npartner because the World Bank today is looking after this kind of new financial\u00a0\nframeworks and creating the market and the big scale opportunity for\u00a0\ngreen hydrogen and green ammonia. I do think that if there is any change, it\u00a0\nwill come from this kind of partnerships. The World Bank has also the ability to bring\u00a0\na lot of stakeholders around the table. Multi-stakeholder partnership is also key to\u00a0\nachieve what we are talking about in this panel. These are my thoughts. [Susana Moreira]\u00a0 I think the World Bank has a\u00a0\nvery critical role to play.

The other aspect that I think is\u00a0\nvery important is really to advocate for developing worlds in this context\u00a0\nbecause there is a lot of potential. We've all seen the maps, but\u00a0\ntranslating that into actual projects is much harder in those\u00a0\ncontexts than in other contexts. I think the World Bank and other\u00a0\ninstitutions like the World Bank really need to help these projects so that we\u00a0\ncan have them participate in auctions like the ones that H2Global organizes.

[Ana Maria Ruz]\nI would like to do just one example. One of the projects that we are co-financing, they are making the calculation\u00a0\nwith software plus 2%, I mean 7.5%. If we could have a rate of 6.5%, they could go with the final cost of hydrogen\u00a0\nfrom 2.5 dollars per kilo to 5.9 dollars per kilo. The cost of financing of the\u00a0\nproduct is very, very important. Just one point, it makes half the\u00a0\ndifference in the final cost of the product. Sorry, and the other issue that is very\u00a0\nimportant is to work in the H4D partnership because it's a way of acknowledge, to experience the opportunity to\u00a0\nsee other projects around the world, and that is very, very important. Also, thinking in the suppliers\u00a0\nof the technology for the project.

[Pilita Clark]\nOkay. All right. Let's plow into it. We don't have a lot of time, unfortunately. As usual, at all these events,\u00a0\neverybody knows it's busy, busy, busy. The big headline of the COP so\u00a0\nfar has been that we have seen more than $400 million worth of commitments\u00a0\nto the climate Loss and Damage fund that the World Bank is hosting. I wonder, Ajay,\u00a0\u00a0 can you tell us when is the\u00a0\nmoney likely to start flowing? Could you give us an idea of the sorts of projects\u00a0\nthat it's likely to be helping to support?

[Ajay Banga]\nActually,\u00a0\u00a0 I don't know either of those right now\u00a0\nbecause it's very early stages for this. You know that it literally just\u00a0\ngot approved over this period. The fact that 420 million have already shown\u00a0\nup, and I think more will come, is a good sign. The reality is the Bank is currently not planning\u00a0\nto play the role of allocating the money. That will be done by a governing\u00a0\nboard that needs to be created that should have representation from the donor\u00a0\ncountries as well as the recipient countries. Our job is like a trustee. We run it, we operate it, we help to make\u00a0\nsure the money goes to the right places and because we know how to do that. But we're not actually currently\u00a0\nbeing seen as the people who decide which dollars go\u00a0\nto whom and which go to whom. That could change. There are conversations going on in\u00a0\nthe countries that could change that. But currently, that is not the case. [Pilita Clark]\nOkay.

Otherwise, 420 million is not going to take\u00a0\nus very far in a loss and damage situation. It's really about getting the numbers established, getting the right fact base\u00a0\ndone, and move on from there. I think you should see if this gets done well, sometime next year when you'll start seeing\u00a0\u00a0 money actually being put out to\u00a0\nhelp countries on the ground. It's similar to the Pandemic\u00a0\nFund, if you think about it. That got created a couple of years ago, and the first lot of money has just gone\u00a0\nout recently three or four months back.

If you look at the world economy today,\u00a0\nit is over $100 trillion economy. Of course, it will continue to grow. By the time we move in the decades, there should be better capacity\u00a0\nto finance any activities. The second question we have to ask ourselves is, is it really climate investment or is it\u00a0\nclimate and development in most cases? If this is the case, then, of course,\u00a0\nwe should not be scared of this amount because investments of that size are\u00a0\nnot necessarily that significant. But then comes the question, even\u00a0\nif we are to be more comfortable that we are not talking about an\u00a0\nimpossible, it is still a mountain to climb. The way we see the climb is to use all\u00a0\npossible instruments we have at our disposal. We are a huge proponent of carbon price. We believe that carbon price has the potential of\u00a0\nraising revenues in a way that is both equitable because the more you consume, the\u00a0\nmore you pollute, the more you pay. It is also an incentive to\u00a0\naccelerate decarbonization. In other words, you would need less money because\u00a0\nof consumption and production adapting to it.

The third source of financing, frankly, is countries being more disciplined in collecting\u00a0\ntaxes from their businesses and their people. When we [signal cut off] at tax collection today, in many developing countries\u00a0\nit is below 15% tax to GDP, which we think is the\u00a0\nminimum you need to function. Even when it is 20%, 22%, 23%, our analysis shows\u00a0\nthat there is space by improving tax collection, especially put it on digital,\u00a0\nnobody can hide, collect it, but also be more aggressive towards taxing\u00a0\nthose that today are avoiding taxation.

First of all, not everything requires trillions. Let's just get away from, for a minute,\u00a0\nrenewable energy is where these numbers go. If you look at methane, methane from rice\u00a0\npaddy cultivation, methane from livestock, methane from waste management, this is not\u00a0\u00a0 trillions that are required\u00a0\nto bend the curve on methane.

If you ask me the correct one,\u00a0\nI'll answer the correct answer. The phase down, I have clarity on. We are working towards it. I believe the practical aspect of phase down requires the mix of renewables and\u00a0\nfossil fuel to change over time. The reality is you need baseload factors in almost\u00a0\u00a0 every country in order to\u00a0\nload on renewables on top. Baseloads come from either\u00a0\nhydroelectric, geothermal, nuclear, or good old-fashioned natural\u00a0\ngas, or God forbid, coal. That's the problem. I think we have to be a little thoughtful\u00a0\nabout what we mean by phase out and phase down. I think the right thing to do is\u00a0\nto aggressively go for phase down with a transition plan that allows\u00a0\nfor things to be done practically.

My view, I've looked at some scientific\u00a0\nreports that say that you could, if you aren't able to solve for all these energy,\u00a0\nagriculture, transportation and construction, you may still need carbon capture\u00a0\nin a relatively active way for 2050.

It's a pleasure to have you here and welcome\nto a session that is under the title, \u201cFrom Analysis to Impact: Connecting Climate\nand Development in Over 40 Countries\u201d. The background of it is that the World Bank\nis not about only climate financing, but it's also about good analytics. We feel we need to have good analytics to\nmake an impact. We have started a whole series of country\nclimate and development reports that is trying to evaluate policy options\nfor governments, particularly as they go having short-term\nchallenges, as well as to see how that path to net zero\nby 2050 is evolving and what challenges the country may face. We started that series last year. Last year in Egypt, we presented a first summary\nreport. We have now a second synthesis report that\nwe will present in a moment. But before we do that, let me introduce also\nthe panelists who have kindly agreed to join me here. First on video is Mr. Nicolas Kazadi, the\nMinister of Finance of the Democratic Republic of Congo.

You cannot be resilient if you're living in\nextreme poverty and you don't have access to basic services. But at the same time, we need resilience to\nsafeguard development gains and not to just walk them back every time\nwe have a crisis. What we find in CCDRs is that countries have\nreadily available opportunities to improve people's lives, health, safety with interventions that boost\nadaptation and resilience. [On screen text]\nAdaptation offers great investment opportunities, but it alone cannot completely prevent climate\nimpacts.

[St\u00e9phane Hallegatte]\nJust to illustrate this point about those investment opportunities in adaptation and\nresilience, here you see economic impacts in a few of\nthe CCDR countries with current policies and with our recommendation in terms of adaptation\nand resilience. Basically, you can gain between two and eight\npercentage points of GDP thanks to those interventions. It's a really good investment. What we find is that the private sector is\nnot investing enough and that's largely because of a lack of supportive\nlegal framework and the right financing tools, but the private sector could play a much bigger\nrole here. We also find that even if you assume perfect\nadaptation, if you do everything right, you cannot cancel all impacts of climate change,\nwhich means adaptation is important. It cannot replace a reduction in global emissions, which, of course, have to start with high-income\ncountries and the biggest emitters.

You see that in most countries what we have\nis a faster GDP growth in those scenarios.

[St\u00e9phane Hallegatte]\nMy fourth message is on spending better because we're talking quite a lot about how\nmuch more investment we need, but our CCDRs also identified opportunities\nto spend better the resources we have already. That's a really important part of the discussion. Of course, we discussed about repurposing\nsubsidies in energy, water, or agriculture so that they can achieve the same development\nand social economic gains, but in a more efficient way. More efficient for public finance, more efficient\nfor the environment. We also talk about trade policy reforms and\nwe flag the obstacles",

We have launched, last month in Kinshasa and\nclearly it is aligned with our vision, supported by our national adaptation strategy. We call DRC a very important country when\nit is related to climate challenges, because for me, we will consider that there is no difference\nbetween development challenges and climate challenges, especially for countries like DRC with what\nit represents in terms of forest, in terms of clean energy potential and in\nterms of strategic minerals. For all these, it is clear that we have to\nwork effectively.

If we remain in inaction, we may put an additional\n16 million people within poverty. Clearly, we need to work. As you said, we need to work fast. Again, we consider our country like a solution\ncountry. At the time, we don't have any time to waste\non forest protection and also on energy. We have a big divide on energy supply. All these are affecting forests, are affecting\ndevelopment. We have a big divide on all that is in regard\nto infrastructure. That means that, clearly, we need a big push\nin investment.

Forests in DRC are a very good blessing for\nthe country and also an opportunity for our development\nand the climate challenges. Our forest contains around 35 gigatons of\nCO2 accumulated and stored. Our country is among the few countries that\nare net carbon sink, removing an estimated 822 megatons of CO2\nper year.

I'm emphasizing this because to point out\nthat it's possible to be done, right? As an opportunity, it's perhaps, for what\nI've seen so far, at least\u2026 [Axel van Trotsenburg]\nCan you just say how that was done? [Jo\u00e3o Paulo de Resende]\nMostly by command-and-control mechanisms. We still have not been able to implement large\nscale incentives, payouts for people to preserve. We're working on that both nationally and\ninternationally because we believe, and this was one of the other points that\nI wanted to make, which is forest extending, they pay out a service to the whole community,\nnot just to the country that holds that forest because the climate is interconnected and\nmany countries would be affected if, for example, the Amazon rainforest came down,\ncompletely down. That's something that we've been trying to\nwork with the international community.

It's also an opportunity because, as I was\ngoing to say, for what I've been able to measure, the cheapest way to withhold carbon is by\nreducing deforestation, at least in Brazil. It's a lot cheaper than any energy alternative. It's a lot cheaper than any agricultural change\nof better practices and environmentally friendly practice. It's cheaper that way, but it's also challenging\nbecause, I don't know if many of you know, but it's large forest regions like the Amazon,\nand I'm sure like the Congo region and the DRC are somewhat of a Wild West in terms of property\nand titles and what belongs to whom and who has a right,\nfor example, to be paid to preserve. This is the major challenge. We'll need certainly satellite imaging, artificial\nintelligence, all kinds of technology that we can use, and\nalso a lot of human effort to... This is the basics of any policy that you\ndo, any regulation and any attempts to keep the forest standing. You have to find out who is responsible for\ncertain parts of it.

Are we doing a little bit also on carbon credits? Maybe just say a word or two on that. [Jennifer J. Sara]\nYeah. On forestry, that is really important. That's the question, how do you keep forest\nstanding? I think in both these countries, it's a really,\nreally important issue. What are the incentives you could provide\nto communities to also to conserve the forests? We've been doing just before earlier this\nmorning, we actually announced all the work that we've\nbeen doing on high integrity carbon markets in the forestry\nsector.

You mentioned property rights, which is one\nof the biggest challenges, but also looking at the indigenous populations\nwho live in these forests, how will they also be able to benefit communities,\nthe benefit sharing plans? That is actually very important. Axel, what the Bank has been doing for many,\nmany years were small projects around the world. We now have 15 countries where we've come\nto scale, where countries then can choose where they\ndo generate these credits.

It's a very big opportunity for us in so many levels, helps out with the community, families, homes, church, everything, In the last decade we've gone from having no contractors in Tonga doing roadworks to now having five, six bidding to do roadworks.

I also own a shop that sells various spare parts, supplies,\nand equipment for fisherfolk. There are about a hundred fisherfolk\nwho are doing business with us. If the price of the fish is 98,000 or 97,000 rupiahs,\nwe usually pay 100,000 bills without expecting change. We round up the payment\nso we can reduce using small change. It is also difficult to get small denominations\nfrom the local banks. So, it can be quite overwhelming for us. As a fish trader, I prefer non-cash transactions. When using electronic money, all transaction data can be recorded\nand easily managed through a phone application. Both income and expenses can be recorded electronically. While for cash transactions, the records are still manually written. Thus, the records sometimes don\u2019t match with the actual cash flows. On average, our (daily) transaction is around 30 million (USD $2,000)\nand all managed by our staff. It would be ideal if all transactions are using e-money, so I can easily monitor them from my phone. When we get cash payments,\nwe tend to spend them without proper control. It's also inconvenient carrying cash. That is not the case if we use e-money. When our house ran out of electricity credit\nin the middle of the night, having e-money is very useful.

In 2021, $500 million more were added, making World Bank the country's first development partner to help with the national vaccination program. The project enabled Bangladesh to vaccinate nearly 50% of its population, giving 68 million doses of vaccines\nand 110 million syringes to administer these.  Large quantities of protective equipment like masks, gloves and coveralls\nwere supplied to frontline workers. Three hundred ventilators helped deal\nwith the increasing number of COVID patients. In 30 public hospitals around the country, liquid medical oxygen systems were built, giving Bangladesh the ability to fight\nall respiratory illnesses, not just COVID.

And that legally binding\ninstrument needed to be done by end of 2024. That is next year. So in 2 short years, the\nambition is to come together to be able to define this legally\nbinding instrument. Clearly there is an agenda for\naddressing plastics in countries, in regions, but also\nglobally. So what are those common\nelements? Because at the end of the day,\nplastic products and plastic pollution are trans boundary in\nnature. We have shared river systems, we\nhave shared coastlines, but we also have shared markets.

So how do we harmonize and bring\ntogether some of these policies so that you have a more even\nplaying field in this regard. The next Inc coming up in\nNairobi affords an incredible opportunity for these countries\nto really think through what it is they can commit to. We are hoping to see a lot more\nconvergence in terms terms of the kinds of options that they\nare looking at. So what are they going to do\nabout single use plastics? What are they going to do about\nadditives and paints that are added to these?

This is the third edition of the annual\u00a0\nLJD Week and the first to be held in person since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. As you already know, the\u00a0\ntheme of this year's event is \u201cPartnering for Impact, Enabling and Mobilizing\u00a0\nthe Private Sector for Sustainable Development.\u201d As the saying goes, if you want to go fast,\u00a0\u00a0 you go alone, but if you want\u00a0\nto go far, you go with someone. The issue is no longer whether international\u00a0\ndevelopment partners such as the public sector, multilateral development banks,\u00a0\ninternational financial institutions, and the private sector should\u00a0\npartner, but how they should partner. The goal of this conference is\u00a0\ntherefore not only to discuss ideas, but also, to discuss how to implement those ideas. We are very excited about these three days\u00a0\nof sharing knowledge, exchanging ideas, and fostering partnerships.",

We are very excited about these three days\u00a0\nof sharing knowledge, exchanging ideas, and fostering partnerships. As you will see from the agenda, the format\u00a0\nof this year's event is a bit different. In the past, we used to have\u00a0\ntwo or three parallel sessions, which meant that a good many of you could\u00a0\nnot attend some of the sessions of interest because they could not be at two\u00a0\nor three places at the same time. This year we have made sure that no one will\u00a0\nhave to deal with such a trilemma or dilemma. Instead of parallel sessions, we\u00a0\nwill have only plenary sessions. We hope you will enjoy the sessions. One important housekeeping note, because\u00a0\nof the hybrid nature of this event, we intend to start on time for every session\u00a0\nbecause people will be joining us virtually. Another is that for fire and safety reasons,\u00a0\nno one should be standing around this room. We have an overflow room,\u00a0\nMC2800, and we have colleagues around that might take you\u00a0\nthere when we have an overflow.

We've worked together with our\u00a0\ncolleagues across the World Bank, our development partners, international\u00a0\norganizations, academics, civil society, and the private sector to deliver to\u00a0\nyou some of the most prominent thinkers, leaders and doers in the\u00a0\ninternational development. We'll discuss with you some of the challenges\u00a0\nfaced and the urgencies faced by the world in the development agenda these days, particularly as they result from pandemic crises and the particular needs of\u00a0\ncountries and vulnerable people. The renewed mission of the World Bank is the\u00a0\neradication of poverty on a livable planet. We're enhancing our financial capacity\u00a0\nto deliver more and better results, outcomes, solutions and to do so at scale. We're thinking more broadly to support\u00a0\nthe strengthening of national systems and policies and capacity to meet\u00a0\nthe sustainable development goals, as well as the challenges brought on by\u00a0\neconomic strains, pandemics, food crises,",

We'll try to produce better and more effective and resilient outcomes working\u00a0\ntogether with partners like all of you. As partners it's critical, as Meke indicated, that we identify solutions\u00a0\ntogether and harness our\u00a0\u00a0 collective resources and knowledge and energies, and deliver better, more coordinated, and\u00a0\nultimately, more effective results on the ground. Throughout our discussions, we'll be emphasizing\u00a0\nthe role of the rule of law in development. The rule of law as an ecosystem of legislation\u00a0\nand laws and the institutions of the regulators and judiciaries that can implement and\u00a0\napply those laws and regulations fairly, effectively, predictably, transparently\u00a0\nand ethically, the rule of law as an indispensable part of the\u00a0\ndevelopment agenda and the critical link between the policy agenda and the policy\u00a0\ndialogue and the results on the ground.

We'll discuss how judiciaries and regulatory\u00a0\u00a0 agencies can improve their\u00a0\nefficiency and effectiveness to apply laws and regulations more efficiently in order to instill investor confidence,\u00a0\nreduce risk, and facilitate that investment.

Hi everyone, my name is Sheila\u00a0\nBraka Musiime and I'm delighted. Welcome, Ajay to a conversation on\u00a0\nunlocking private finance for the future. Our time is short and we have\u00a0\na lot of ground to cover. So let me ask you the first question, Ajay,\u00a0\nlet's talk about the current landscape, you are six months in at this job, how\u00a0\nwould you characterize the broader context in which the World Bank is operating? What do you see as the main challenges\u00a0\nthe World Bank must address? Ajay Banga:\nYes, thank you\u00a0\u00a0 very much Sheila, and I'm sorry I\u00a0\ncan't be with you all in person, but I am headed off to Singapore\u00a0\nas Chris just mentioned. The question's a great one. I would say from the time that I\u00a0\nbecame a nominee and started traveling, I had a chance to visit about 93 different sets of\u00a0\ncountries in different ways and met civil society and some asset managers and operators\u00a0\nin various parts of the private sector.

And the first one is that we\u00a0\ndon't have the luxury of dealing with separate little neat\u00a0\ncompartmentalized boxes of problems, thinking that we can solve poverty,\u00a0\nseparately from shared prosperity, separately from climate change, separately\u00a0\nfrom fragility, conflict and violence, separately from food insecurity,\u00a0\nseparately from pandemics, these don't unfortunately\u00a0\noperate in separate neat boxes. And so, the intertwined nature of these\u00a0\ncrises where they feed off each other, and you can see that happening and unfolding\u00a0\neven now in the tragic war in the Middle East, you saw that over the last couple\u00a0\nof years with the war in Ukraine and all the conflicts in Africa\u00a0\nthat have been going on for a while, the pandemic, climate issues, water availability,\u00a0\nthese are all intertwined with poverty. And trying to segregate them\u00a0\nis not going to work easily; and therefore, you have to\u00a0\namend the vision of the Bank to not only focus on poverty\u00a0\nand sharing prosperity, but on getting engaged and involved with\u00a0\nthe intertwined nature of these crises. That's one big first learning. The second one has been the growing\u00a0\nmistrust, and I use that word carefully,",

The second one has been the growing\u00a0\nmistrust, and I use that word carefully, between the Global South and the Global North. And what I mean by that is that the\u00a0\ndeveloping world feels that the manner in which development has worked thus far, is\u00a0\nnow the consequences of that heavy emissions, heavy growth is now being borne by them, those\u00a0\nwho contribute the least to it being one example. But then they also feel that the rules of\u00a0\nenergy access don't apply equally to them. So, if you were to go to Africa, and there are 600\u00a0\nmillion people without any form of energy access and there's over a billion people in the\u00a0\nworld, billion and a half or close to it, with intermittent forms of energy access,\u00a0\nand they feel that they're being told that they cannot use natural gas as a transition\u00a0\nto getting energy is a challenge for them. Now remember, there's good\u00a0\narguments on both sides. I'm not getting into that right now, I'm\u00a0\njust telling you what I saw and heard. And then, of course,\u00a0\u00a0 they feel that the reconstruction\u00a0\nof Ukraine, when it does come about, as well as now for that\u00a0\nmatter, what will be required is a heavy injection of capital into Palestine\u00a0\nand Gaza one day when this war comes to an end, all this will take away from their ability\u00a0\nto do the right thing for their citizens.",

And so, there is a fear and a concern that they\u00a0\nwill not get a chance or a fair shake at the till. So that leads to a growing\u00a0\ndistrust and a gap between them. And I think what I'm seeing the Bank\u00a0\nas an institution do, and need to do, is its role is even more\u00a0\ncritical, it cannot do it alone, because there's not enough money in the Bank's\u00a0\ncoffers or in the coffers of governments, so you need the right partnerships and so on. But at the end of the day, we are\u00a0\ndealing with a far more complicated world with these crises that are intertwined and\u00a0\nwith this mistrust than we were in the past. That to me is the real context of it. Sheila Braka Musiime:\nAjay, you were clearly\u00a0\u00a0 mindful of this dynamic when\u00a0\nyou walked into the Bank, these intertwined challenges, the mistrust\u00a0\nbetween the Global North and the Global South. One of the first things that\u00a0\nyou did was to try and reorient this 78-year-old institution\u00a0\nwith a new vision statement.

But what are you trying to achieve\u00a0\nwith this new mission and vision? Ajay Banga:\nI think the first\u00a0\u00a0 thing is that to move past poverty and\u00a0\nnot forget that eradicating poverty, eradicating inequality is a mission-critical issue\u00a0\nfor humanity, forget just the Bank, for all of us. Everybody deserves a fair\u00a0\nopportunity in their life to\u00a0\u00a0 lead it to the fullness of what they're capable. And to me; therefore, you can't get\u00a0\naway from that issue of inequality. Inequality to me is a problem that gets\u00a0\nmanifested in education, in health access, in financial access and opportunity,\u00a0\u00a0 but inequality is reflected in\u00a0\nthe way genders are treated, it's reflected in the way ethnicity is handled,\u00a0\nit's reflected in the way religious differences, sexual orientation differences, or frankly just your bad luck to be born on\u00a0\nthe wrong side of the tracks are handled.",

And to me; therefore, inequality\u00a0\nhas to be worked really hard on. And that's why the eradication of poverty\u00a0\nis part of the first part of that vision. The problem, as I said, is you can't do that\u00a0\nwithout the other intertwined challenges. The idea of introducing a livable planet\u00a0\nis that if you cannot breathe clean air, if you cannot drink clean water, what\u00a0\nkind of a life do you actually have? If you basically spend your life\u00a0\non the run, as a refugee, today, refugees are in a refugee mindset, on\u00a0\nthe average, for 16 years at a time. From the time they start thinking of leaving their\u00a0\nhome to take dangerous journeys to go elsewhere and live a life that is still very difficult\u00a0\nto the time they actually settle down, on the average it's 16 years, that's a lifetime. You will have children, parents\u00a0\nwill die, kids will go to school. A whole life goes by in those 16 years. If you're unsettled for those 16 years,\u00a0\nthat's not a productive individual in society. It's really hard for them. And so, I think you have to realize\u00a0\nthe fact that a livable planet, meaning a planet that is worth living in that\u00a0\u00a0",

That's the idea of merging those\u00a0\ntwo into one vision statement so we can expand the aperture by which the\u00a0\u00a0 Bank looks at a challenge and\u00a0\nthen tries to organize itself to actually fight those challenges\u00a0\nin this fuller holistic context. That's the first thing. The second thing we've done is to specifically\u00a0\nincorporate the needs of women and young people. That does not mean that we don't appreciate other\u00a0\nsmaller marginalized issues and communities, don't get me wrong, they're all important. Remember, we start with removing\u00a0\ninequality caused by different biases, but the fact of picking women, first of\u00a0\nall, is half the population is women. And the reality of even the developed world is that women do not get all the\u00a0\nopportunities that they deserve to get. In fact, I would argue that if they were to\u00a0\nget, they would make the world a better place.

The second part of that is\u00a0\nyoung people, the Global South, which is where we are focused in\u00a0\nterms of our developmental efforts has a very large percentage of\u00a0\nits population in young people. The world often speaks to\u00a0\nthat as a demographic dividend in the sense that as that goes through the\u00a0\npipe, it'll lead to greater productivity, greater jobs and so on and so forth. That only works if these young people actually\u00a0\nhave quality of life when they're growing up, meaning clean air, clean water,\u00a0\neducation, health, that kind of thing. And then, once they're grown up,\u00a0\nthey must get access to jobs. Jobs are what gives them dignity. Jobs are what give them a desire\u00a0\nto live and work every day. And jobs are what keep them\u00a0\nsocially correctly active. If you don't do that, you run the risk of\u00a0\ndemographic challenges, not demographic dividends.",

In my way of thinking, these challenges are now\u00a0\nso big and so complex that all of us in this room, multilateral banks,\u00a0\ngovernments, the private sector, we're going to have to play at the top of our game if they're going to be able to move the\u00a0\nneedle on the level of issues they are facing. I have optimism about it, don't get\u00a0\nme wrong. I believe it can be done, but I believe it has to be done the right way. One of the first things you have to\u00a0\ndo is to make sure that the Bank, the World Bank, operates in the\u00a0\nbest possible way that it can. And what I mean by that is everything\u00a0\nranging from efficiency and effectiveness, meaning it takes us 27 months on\u00a0\nthe average from the time a project starts getting worked upon to the time\u00a0\nthat the first dollar gets disbursed. It could take up to 10 years, of\u00a0\ncourse, for a project to be fully active and its full results and outcomes to be visible. But in those 27 months at the beginning, there are many steps that we've got to look\u00a0\nat again and see whether we in collaboration",

It's harder in some cases from the time the\u00a0\u00a0 project is approved to the\u00a0\ntime the first dollar goes because there you've got governments\u00a0\nand parliaments involved, but that doesn't mean that it's a\u00a0\ntopic we must not take on, we must. Because at the end of the day,\u00a0\ndevelopment delayed is development denied and 27 months is a very long time. And so, trying to get that to work\u00a0\nbetter by operating differently ourselves is the first starting point of this. A second point in there is the\u00a0\nidea of outcomes rather than input. So yes, we need to measure dollars disbursed and\u00a0\nnumber of projects financed in different things, but I think outcomes as in number\u00a0\nof girls who went to school, people who got a better job because of\u00a0\nthe skilling institute we helped to open or the area around the bus rapid\u00a0\ntransit system that developed better because of that BRT or carbon emissions avoided,\u00a0\nthat kind of thing to me is equally important;",

I want to get us to that along with the other MDBs and a number of things that are\u00a0\nin the process on that front. A third topic of that type\u00a0\nhas to do with partnerships. As I said right at the beginning, I don't\u00a0\nthink there's enough money or effort that can be done out of just us\u00a0\nor the other MDBs or governments. We need the private sector. We need its energy, we need its capital,\u00a0\nwe need its innovation, we need its people, its technology to come to the party, particularly when there is a rational\u00a0\nbusiness model that they can work upon. Can the World Bank and other institutions\u00a0\nhelp to reduce some of the risk that the private sector is not trained\u00a0\nto handle or incapable of factoring into their way of thinking about their return on\u00a0\ncapital, things that are outside of their control in such a way that prevents them\u00a0\nfrom investing in these markets even when the technology and scale is ready?

And I think the last part I'd\u00a0\ntouch on is the knowledge bank. I believe our institution is both\u00a0\na money bank and a knowledge bank. A lot of countries really appreciate\u00a0\nus not just for the money we provide, that's important, particularly\u00a0\nif you're a poorer country, the IDA grants and concessional financing,\u00a0\nlonger term financing is very helpful, but the reality is we are\u00a0\na knowledge bank as well, and I think we're going to organize our\u00a0\nknowledge bank into these verticals of people, prosperity, planet, infrastructure and digital.

This conference that we've convened\u00a0\nis really about partnering for impact. It's about enabling and\u00a0\nmobilizing the private sector. And so, we also have in the\u00a0\nroom private sector partners, general councils from different\u00a0\nprivate sector companies and entities. And so, I just want to segue into\u00a0\nthat and to keep your thoughts flowing on this whole topic of partnering\u00a0\nand the private sector. You've talked about the\u00a0\nchallenges that are immense,\u00a0\u00a0 climate change, poverty, inequality, fragility, and analysts have put a cost to this and\u00a0\nthey're talking about a trillion US dollars, and that's a trillion each and\u00a0\nevery year, it sounds mind-boggling.",

And so, really, it's critical that we align\u00a0\nourselves to what the private sector wants and you've come from a private sector\u00a0\nbackground and you know what that can look like. I want you to try and help us\u00a0\nas we get into this week to try and see how we can maximize the\u00a0\nimpact of all these initiatives that we are starting together as the World Bank.

I think they're a key part of this\u00a0\nand that we don't end up with thinking that the trillions that are\u00a0\nrequired for everything,\u00a0\u00a0 which are numbers put out by various bodies, should not frighten us because I\u00a0\nthink that leads to the wrong answers.",

First of all, not everything requires trillions. To give you an example in climate,\u00a0\nto me methane is a very big issue. Methane, the emissions of methane from say\u00a0\u00a0 farming from rice patty can be\u00a0\naltered fairly substantially, close to eight or nine percent of methane\u00a0\nemissions in the world come from that, and that can be reduced by 40-odd percent by\u00a0\nfollowing different rice growing practices, which require less amount of water to be flooding\u00a0\nthe field all the time through the period, you need periodic irrigation and so on. These are not as expensive as say, setting\u00a0\nup capacity in solar and wind energy, which is where the trillion\u00a0\nstart being spoken about. I think we shouldn't lose sight of the fact\u00a0\u00a0 that many things can be done\u00a0\nwith lower resources as well and they must be done, and we\u00a0\nshouldn't only focus on the big dollars and the big zeros at the end of every number. That's kind of important. The second part is I do not believe that\u00a0\u00a0",

These are very interconnected\u00a0\nand important issues, and the bigger Bank not only requires\u00a0\nadequacy of capital from current things that we're doing with hybrid and\u00a0\nportfolio guarantees and the like, but eventually will require capital increases. We are finally the voice of the ambition of our\u00a0\nshareholders and the ambition of our shareholders needs to be reflected in the way in which the Bank\u00a0\ngets capitalized for the challenges we see ahead. Even to be a good partner for\u00a0\nthe private sector to help\u00a0\u00a0 manage some of the risks for the political risks, or foreign exchange risks or other risks that\u00a0\nthey feel are outside their ambit of influence, even to do that would require us\u00a0\nto have a stronger balance sheet than we would have today to\u00a0\nmeet the aspirations they have. think both these points are important.

Now, the point about lots of sources of money\u00a0\nas well, there's subsidies we could look at. There's a trillion plus dollars of subsidies that\u00a0\ngo out into the world every year on fossil fuels and agriculture and fisheries, and if you look at\u00a0\nthe harmful environmental impact of some of those, it adds up to six-odd trillion in a year. That's 7.25 trillion a year. I'm not saying you divert all of that. A lot of those subsidies are very important for\u00a0\u00a0 people at the lower end of\u00a0\nthe spectrum on earnings, so don't do that, but you can repurpose them. The European Union repurposed 60\u00a0\nbillion of the subsidies that used to go into incremental fertilizer use with all\u00a0\nthe drain off and problems associated, the same 60 billion goes to farmers to\u00a0\nencourage them to reduce fertilizing. That's an intelligent way to repurpose\u00a0\nsubsidies in a smart way to change behavior and to change environmental impact. There are many ways to think about subsidies.",

The wrong way to think about\u00a0\nthem is we can't change them. In the same way, there is much we\u00a0\ncan do with voluntary carbon markets. Yes, there's criticism about greenwashing and\u00a0\nthe like, that is fair, we need to do it better, but not doing it is also not an answer because\u00a0\neventually hoping that somehow taxes will work, where rich countries will tax their citizens\u00a0\nto send money to the Global South far away to change something there is not a\u00a0\nlikely circumstance in democracies; and therefore, we're going to have to find a\u00a0\nway to create voluntary movements of money, one of the best ways of doing that is to\u00a0\ncontinue to invest in voluntary carbon markets and ensure that they're done\u00a0\nin a way that avoids criticism and in fact, is seen as\u00a0\nconstructive over the years to come. Backing away from them, being scared\u00a0\nof doing them would also be a mistake. Doing them the right way and improving all\u00a0\u00a0 the time is the only correct\u00a0\nway to approach that topic. All those are important.

And then there's the role of the private\u00a0\nsector, which I know is what you want to get to. To me, that role is really important. As I said, most private sector\u00a0\ninvestors, right now, if you ask someone, \"Are you willing to invest in renewable\u00a0\nenergy projects in Indonesia?\" There would be enough private\u00a0\nsector investors, operators, as well as long-term asset\u00a0\nmanagers who would consider\u00a0\u00a0 that to be a relatively attractive thing to do. Solar and wind and geothermal and the\u00a0\nlike have now got proven technology, and proven technology at scale where\u00a0\nthe per unit cost of these technologies is lower than the per unit cost of fossil fuel. Yes, there is a longer gestation\u00a0\nperiod, a higher capital investment and a time period required\u00a0\nbefore those lines cross over. So, the question is can we reduce some of\u00a0\nthe risks that hold the private sector back from investing in that\u00a0\nparticular country to change and bend the arc of emissions and\u00a0\nemission-heavy growth in the future? And I think there you come to\u00a0\npolitical risk and regulatory risk. The first question there is, does\u00a0\nthe country have a clear roadmap on where it's going with renewable energy?",

They understand it might change,\u00a0\nbut it shows vision and a purpose. You combine that; therefore, with the\u00a0\nright regulatory policies on the ground that relate with tariff policy or\u00a0\nthe policy around those energies and the policy around\u00a0\ntransmission and distribution. Once you lay those out with the right approach\u00a0\u00a0 for an investor to feel that\u00a0\nthere are legal protections in place to enable them to get the right recourse\u00a0\nin the event of challenges, that changes a lot. And even then, they may have\u00a0\npolitical risk attached to it. That's what MIGA and the MIGA\u00a0\nguarantee system can help to do. Then there is the issue of foreign exchange\u00a0\nrisk, which is still a very difficult one. But if you're investing in dollars, euros and yen and your repayment in terms\u00a0\nof being paid by utility, I'm still on renewable energy,\u00a0\u00a0 is in local currency, clearly there\u00a0\nis an issue there for you to hedge.

We have a lot of colleagues from the\u00a0\nlegal community here in this room today, and I just want you to share some\u00a0\nreflections on the role of the rule of law. How can it help us in this endeavor? Ajay Banga:\nYeah, well listen,\u00a0\u00a0 this whole idea of regulatory policy and of clarity on the rule of\u00a0\nwhat and how an investor knows what they're signing up for\u00a0\nwhen they're investing, some\u00a0\u00a0 degree of clarity there, that's where it helps.

So, the rule of law is critical,\u00a0\u00a0 policymaking combined with the\u00a0\nright implementation of that policy so you can get recourse as an investor requires the partnership of policymakers\u00a0\nand the legal system in a country. I think that's kind of what\u00a0\nthis can really be helpful too. In a way, it plays some of that role\u00a0\nbecause of providing the ability to, if you get into a dispute with a sovereign,\u00a0\u00a0 the ability to try and find a\u00a0\nway to have a settlement there. There are similar bodies that do\u00a0\nit with two private sector parties that get into disputes like my old association\u00a0\nwith the International Chamber of Commerce. But you need to be able to find\u00a0\na way for investors to feel that they have a sense of being able to address a\u00a0\nchallenge on what they were told they could take as the terms of a transaction when they entered. I think that's where the rule\u00a0\nof law becomes really important. It's very reassuring to them.

I do believe that our knowledge bank\u00a0\nand our legal team can be good partners for the other MDBs and the private sector in\u00a0\nhow we approach this challenge across countries because of bringing forward what kind of\u00a0\nexperiences we have where the right policies and the right legal structure can\u00a0\nlead to increases in investment from the private sector in certain kinds of areas. Along with this, by the way, is the aspect of\u00a0\nnot every investment has to come from overseas. If you can build and develop local capital markets\u00a0\nand local and domestic resources in the right way, that can be very helpful as well in\u00a0\ncreating the right investment atmosphere.

Sheila Braka Musiime:\nGreat. Ajay, you've been really generous with your\u00a0\ntime, but I have to ask you one last question. I mean I feel both the urgency as well\u00a0\nas the optimism in what you've said. I just want to give you the opportunity\u00a0\nto share, as you close today, what gives you hope and\u00a0\nwhy should we feel hopeful? Ajay Banga:\nI have two sources of hope. One has to do with the people\u00a0\nat the Bank where I work. I believe that if you want\u00a0\nto get development done, you need subject matter experts with\u00a0\nthe kind of experiences in complicated, difficult geographies that many\u00a0\npeople in this institution have had. I never ceased to be amazed when I travel and meet even young people in the\u00a0\ninstitution with their knowledge, their dedication and their set of experiences\u00a0\nthat have brought them to the institution. That's an invaluable asset. It's a very important arrow in your quiver, and\u00a0\nI believe that if you don't have the right teams, you can't succeed in such a difficult task. So that's one set of optimism. The credibility of the Bank to me that everybody\u00a0\ntalks about, our convening power and so on,",

The second part of my optimism\u00a0\nhas to do with the audience we are dealing with out there in the\u00a0\ncountries, and that's young people. As I started out by saying that young people\u00a0\nare a large proportion in the Global South, I believe that it is their optimism, their\u00a0\ndynamism, their desire for improvement, their hyperconnectivity, technology\u00a0\nis enabling some of that, technology harnessed the right way can be the\u00a0\nbiggest asset multiplier for young people. So that to me, this young people technology\u00a0\ncombination is my second big source of optimism and I'm kind of hoping that these two\u00a0\nthings together make a magic mantra.

How does the World Bank determine which\u00a0\nprograms are needed in which countries and how would the Bank determine which\u00a0\nlaw reforms are needed in those countries? Christopher Stephens:\nWell, thank you Stevan and hello again everyone. I think to that point, it's very important to\u00a0\nunderscore that the World Bank doesn't determine, that we are country-led in our\u00a0\ndevelopment agenda and it's very important that the country identifies for itself\u00a0\nits development agenda and the priorities in which it pursues that agenda, and then\u00a0\nwe determine through dialogue with them what ways in which we can help them establish\u00a0\npriorities, what ways we can engage, what are the roles for the\u00a0\nBank, other multilaterals,\u00a0\u00a0 domestic resource mobilization, and the rest. For our part, we have to work through\u00a0\nthe Country Management Unit, or CMU, in the context of the regional vice presidency\u00a0\nbecause they're the ones who are on the ground and have that dialogue and are\u00a0\ncharged with the responsibility of being most familiar with the needs\u00a0\nof the country and their priorities.

Stevan Jackson:\nYes, and I\u00a0\u00a0 appreciated Ajay mentioning that as well, that the MDBs and private sector can\u00a0\npartner with your vice presidency. So, how specifically do or would lawyers advance\u00a0\nthe development agenda in the way Ajay noted? Christopher Stephens:\nWell, I think there's\u00a0\u00a0 an expansive role for lawyers. Obviously, we have the traditional role of making\u00a0\nsure that our programming and the operations that we initiate comply with the articles and\u00a0\nthe rules in the country partnership framework. But increasingly, I think lawyers are\u00a0\nperceived to have that range of experience.

And that gives us a perspective\u00a0\nand an accumulation of knowledge that I think we can usefully deploy\u00a0\nin moving the agenda forward, in programming generally and in other projects. But most importantly, I think lawyers can be involved\u00a0\nin some of the law reforms work that strengthen institutions to mitigate\u00a0\nrisks and to advance the development agenda. They can be involved in capacity\u00a0\nbuilding both among government officials, government lawyers, regulators and judiciaries\u00a0\nand in the creation of model laws or law reforms. We're working on some model law reforms,\u00a0\none is the Model Forest Act Initiative led by Justice Antonio Benjamin in Brazil,\u00a0\nand organized by the Asian Development Bank with UNDP and others to try\u00a0\nto design a model forest act that would set out the best way\u00a0\nto preserve and manage forests, which is an essential component\u00a0\nto managing carbon sinks and otherwise preserving forests for future\u00a0\ngenerations in the face of the threat",

And so, there's that sensitive balance. Lawyers can do surveys and find out what\u00a0\nare the trends and what are the successes, and try to bring that knowledge together,\u00a0\ntogether with partners to put out a model act. We can do that in gender, in agriculture,\u00a0\u00a0 the energy transition not only\u00a0\nhas to be an energy transition, but it has to be a just energy transition because the transition can obviously\u00a0\nbe very disruptive to people and we need to make sure that their lives\u00a0\nand the impact on them is looked after, regulated and then managed\u00a0\nappropriately and fairly. So, there's almost an infinite capacity for\u00a0\nlawyers' engagement in the development agenda. Stevan Jackson:\nSure.

Christopher Stephens:\nWell, it's tough because\u00a0\u00a0 as challenging as Ajay just mentioned, with respect to traditional operations,\u00a0\ninfrastructure, energy, agriculture, where we might have a 27-month development\u00a0\ntimeline in 10 years before we can see and measure impact on the ground, law reforms\u00a0\ncan be at least as long, including where... It\u2019s not the change you're seeking to\u00a0\u00a0 affect is not just a question of\u00a0\nchanging the rules and the laws, but changing mindsets and\u00a0\nthe way people have behaved or their cultural approaches to issues,\u00a0\u00a0 particularly on human capital,\u00a0\ngender equality, engagement. It takes a more holistic and longer\u00a0\ntimeline to be able to get that done. But we start with programs that are supported by\u00a0\nsound economic and evidence-based data analytics so that we have specific goals in mind and\u00a0\ndesign a program, just as we do for operations, that is targeted to achieve specifically\u00a0\nidentified and measurable outcomes. So that at the end of that,\u00a0\nwhen the project is implemented, we can go back and assess whether or not\u00a0\nthose outcomes were actually achieved.",

In part because we're fiduciaries, we're\u00a0\nspending other people's money, taxpayer's money, and for you here, it's your money and we\u00a0\nhave an obligation to invest it responsibly. And so, we have to have measurable outcomes to make sure we're doing the\u00a0\njob properly and prudently. And it\u2019s the key now I think is the extent to\u00a0\nwhich we can increasingly work with our knowledge, and not just the knowledge that Ajay referred to,\u00a0\nbut the data analytics that I mentioned earlier. Two important respects are that\u00a0\nour development economics group under our Chief Economist generates a number\u00a0\nof very important reports and diagnoses. One is the \u201cCountry Climate and\u00a0\nDevelopment Report\u201d or CCDRs. So, for each country, they're producing\u00a0\na report that analyzes the progress that each country is making towards\u00a0\nits own climate development plans and the extent to which it's falling short. And in many cases, the shortfalls are\u00a0\nattributable to deficits in regulation, inefficiencies in judicial\u00a0\nframeworks or inadequacy in\u00a0\u00a0 laws that are hindering their development.

It's also a good example of\u00a0\nthe changing of mindsets. Every country who's a member of the World Bank\u00a0\nGroup appoints a principal liaison to the Bank. And for most countries it's\u00a0\nthe Minister of Finance. The Minister of Finance has an enormous\u00a0\ntask and many, many things on her agenda.

A good reason back then why many\u00a0\nof our private sector legal counsel were advising their clients to avoid institutions\u00a0\nlike this, but they were a very project specific. If you wanted to borrow from an MDB, you would have to comply with their\u00a0\nenvironmental and social standards. And to that extent, those standards would be\u00a0\napplied in that project, as Sheila mentioned. Better yet, if we can extend\u00a0\nand expand the application of higher and better environmental and\u00a0\nsocial standards across the country so that they're applying them universally\u00a0\nand ultimately perhaps even embedded in their legal framework\u00a0\nfor general applicability. And so, we're working with\u00a0\nother development partners, and have been for many years, to\u00a0\ntry to see how we can do that. One of the problems that we create though is\u00a0\nbecause there's an absence of harmonization or even insufficient coordination that\u00a0\nthe poor borrower is trying to deal with different standards from\u00a0\ndifferent institutions and at\u00a0\u00a0 the same time suffering from limited capacity.

And yet, harmonization hasn't been\u00a0\nsuccessful largely across the board. There's a lot more we can do\u00a0\nto make this more effective. And so, that I think is going to be the future, is how we can get together and try to\u00a0\ndetermine some set of more harmonization, and not just environmental and social, but in procurement, anti-corruption\u00a0\nand other standards, particularly as the countries suffer\u00a0\nsome of the urgencies they have, we need to get the money out\u00a0\nthere, we need to work together, but working together doesn't\u00a0\nmean delivering more inconsistent and burdensome requirements on clients.

Christopher Stephens:\nWell, I'll let Sheila speak,\u00a0\u00a0 but my thoughts would be, conferences\u00a0\nlike these are nice to get together and network and brainstorm and hear lots of nice\u00a0\nthoughts from lots of nice and smart people, whenever they come up in the agenda,\u00a0\nin the latter parts of the agenda, but seriously to be able to listen to each other and really think about how we can work together and deliver respective knowledge and\u00a0\nsystems and expertise more efficiently; and therefore, more effectively. Because if we bring a confusing set of\u00a0\nobjectives and requirements to the market, we're going to not only\u00a0\nconfuse and burden clients, we're going to be working against their own\u00a0\nability to achieve their development agenda and ultimately our own goals. So, we have to figure out a way to work\u00a0\ntogether to bring better solutions to clients. I think part of that is capacity building. We can do capacity building with the\u00a0\ngovernment officials, with judiciaries. We can do work with judiciaries\u00a0\nto further their own, most of them have strategic agendas and plans\u00a0\nabout their own efficiencies and effectiveness.",

So, the partnership part of the theme\u00a0\nof this Group I think is very important. Stevan Jackson:\nSheila, what say you? Sheila Braka Musiime:\nYeah, so conferences\u00a0\u00a0 like this are incredible, but I want to\u00a0\nsay also that it doesn't just stop here. So many of the colleagues in the room have been\u00a0\ninvolved with each other in different ways. Some of them have been informal\u00a0\nnetworks of lawyers across MDBs,\u00a0\u00a0 and this is incredibly useful. And a shout-out to a [inaudible],\u00a0\nwhich we just joined a few months ago, bringing together legal practitioners from across\u00a0\nour institutions to discuss topics of interest. But we've also worked together, for\u00a0\ninstance, in the establishment of AAIB and that partnership that we had to align our\u00a0\u00a0 policies and procedures to\u00a0\nmake sure, as Chris says, when we show up in a country, we are\u00a0\nnot each coming with our thick policies, but we actually have a very\u00a0\naligned way of working.",

And we are trying to do that with\u00a0\nmore and more MDBs across the board, and not just in specific projects. But talking about the things\u00a0\nthat happen after LJD Week. We also have the Global Forum\u00a0\nand The Compact and Forum, which is a very useful tool to\u00a0\nkeep on bringing people together, practitioners around the world on specific topics, to dive deeper outside this\u00a0\nweek into what needs to shift. That all will inform then the projects\u00a0\nthat we do, the operations that we do. This link between knowledge and lending,\u00a0\nI think just has to be very seamless, and that's what we want to promote. Christopher Stephens:\nI think that's very important,\u00a0\u00a0 just to underscore what\u00a0\nSheila said about the value, not only of the lawyers who\u00a0\nare in other institutions, but private sector lawyers who might\u00a0\nengage through their law societies, through The Compact and Forum, through the\u00a0\nGlobal Forum on Law, Justice and Development, these are great organizations to try\u00a0\nto harness those energies and knowledge",

It has to be able to identify the risks\u00a0\nand then needs sufficient risk mitigation, as Ajay mentioned, in order to gain\u00a0\nthe confidence to make investments. In private sector investment,\u00a0\nit's all about risks and rewards. It has to have an understanding of what those\u00a0\nrisks are, it doesn't have to eliminate them, but it needs to be able to mitigate them\u00a0\nto an acceptable level of residual risk. And then, we need to know on the\u00a0\nbenefits side and the reward side that we have sufficient systems for\u00a0\ncapital markets, currency, repatriation, and then a judiciary and regulatory agencies that\u00a0\u00a0 are going to enforce all\u00a0\nthis in a predictable way. Predictability is critical to build investor\u00a0\nconfidence and so these legal systems supported by the legal function, I think are\u00a0\ncritical to engaging the private sector. And that's what we mean by\u00a0\nprivate sector enabling. We have to enable an investor friendly environment before the private sector can\u00a0\ncome in and do a proper assessment and invest its capital with some degree of\u00a0\u00a0 certainty about that risk and\u00a0\nthe ability to earn a return.",

As Ajay said, these trillions are not going to\u00a0\nbe found in one place, we need the bigger Bank, but we also need the private sector. It's really urgent that we as legal\u00a0\npractitioners are ahead of this conversation because it all boils down to those agreements,\u00a0\nthose understandings that are reached. I think the worst thing that can happen for\u00a0\nus is that decisions are made at a top level on how to partner without\u00a0\nthe lawyers really figuring\u00a0\u00a0 out what this actually means in terms of rights and responsibilities and in terms\u00a0\nof the history of our organizations and where our organizations should go.

And how can they work with the World\u00a0\nBank and other MDBs in this endeavor? Sheila? Sheila, you go first. Sheila Braka Musiime:\nI'm happy to go first. I\u00a0\u00a0 think I'll just reiterate that whole\u00a0\nissue of risk and risk sharing. We're going into highly fragile environments,\u00a0\nthis is where our focus is as an institution, and even in our middle income countries,\u00a0\nthere are high pockets of fragility. We're seeing that now in the world right now, the big wars that are being fought are\u00a0\nnot necessarily in our poorest countries, but also in our middle-income countries.",

We're seeing that now in the world right now, the big wars that are being fought are\u00a0\nnot necessarily in our poorest countries, but also in our middle-income countries. And so, how to identify the\u00a0\nrisks, not overblow them, but also not underplay them and agree\u00a0\non how this risk sharing will happen. Some of this is going to need MDBs\u00a0\nlike ours to shoulder some of the risk, but there's going to be some risk that needs\u00a0\nto be shouldered by the private sector. So, we have players like MIGA, and I believe\u00a0\nAradhana [Kumar-Capoor] should be in the room. We have IFC, Ramit [Nagpal] should be in the\u00a0\nroom who are dealing with this on a daily basis and can help us in how we identify those\u00a0\nrisks and how we manage them across the board. Stevan Jackson:\nSo, Chris, what are your thoughts? Christopher Stephens:\nYeah, I think that's right\u00a0\u00a0 and I think too, we don't have to work isolation. To bang the old drum, there's so\u00a0\nmany ideas from here in this room and among our development\u00a0\npartners that we would be foolish to try to invent the wheel in each\u00a0\ninstitution or in each circumstance. We have to do a better job\u00a0\nworking with each other. The feedback that we get in\u00a0\nthe field, quite frankly, is that the World Bank has not always been as\u00a0\u00a0",

And for general counsels in private companies who are increasingly trying to encourage\u00a0\ntheir lawyers to get involved in community, support and things of this\u00a0\nnature, in my experience, lawyers that work on these\u00a0\nreform efforts, lawmaking,\u00a0\u00a0 capacity building, look back on their career and think that these projects were the most\u00a0\u00a0 rewarding things that they'd\u00a0\nworked on in their career.

It's been a lot of work and who\u00a0\nwork every day both in the field, we have several lawyers who\u00a0\nare based in country offices and those who are based in\u00a0\nheadquarters at different levels.

Air pollution causes an estimated 2 million premature deaths every year and impacts social and economic growth. It is not restricted by borders. More than 50% of air pollution in major cities in South Asia travels from outside. How do we tackle this? What are the most effective responses for clean air? The World Bank report Striving for Clean Air in South Asia presents four scenarios, each based on different policies and degrees of coordination between cities, states, and countries. The first scenario looks at scaling up existing air quality measures which mainly target power and transport sector, and large industries. But, there is no coordination with the neighboring countries. In this scenario, the concentration of particulate matter or PM 2.5, which are fine particles of dust or soot, is reduced to 37 micrograms per cubic meter. This falls short of WHO\u2019s least ambitious target of air quality, which is 35 micrograms per cubic meter.",

In the second scenario, all available measures to control emissions are implemented, new technologies are put in place, with no cost consideration. This improves air quality significantly to 17 micrograms per cubic meter saves more than 1.2 million lives but at double the cost of nearly 160 billion per year. The third scenario focuses on cost-effective measures  that target air pollution hot spots, with limited regional coordination. The results are healthy air quality at 26 micrograms per cubic meter, 740,000 lives saved at the cost of over $ 93 billion per year. In the last scenario, cost effective measures are put in place",

Our goal is to help people who have a\nbackground in robotics and drones to learn more, get more knowledge, get cutting\nedge tools to solve local challenges. What's groundbreaking about drones\nis that they are affordable. So we used to have to pay very large amounts\nof money to collect aerial imagery in the past, including large campaigns\nwith millions of dollars. You can buy some of\nthese drones for 1,500 dollars. The typical range of a low-cost, cheap drone will\nbe 10 square kilometers in one mission or less. So they make a lot of sense for monitoring\nchange that is very detailed \u2013 high-resolution changes that you need\nsomething up-to-date, quick.

In some conflict-affected communities,\nthey do have rumors spreading that drones are here bomb them, or they\u2019re\nhere to map their lands and take them away. So they might try to shoot at the drones.\nThey may try to attack the drone operator. So it's important to have some\nconsultation, some interaction with, usually it's the air force or\nsome organ of the state. You want to have some\nliaison or some supervision.

Approving the flight lines, the time of operations, the conspicuousness of the drone, not\njust for humans, but also for wildlife. Some drones can look like a bird of prey\nand if you fly at the wrong time of year, nesting eagles may take it as a\nthreat and may attack the drone. So these are lessons that have been\nlearned the hard way, that need to be codified and they should appear\nin a drone operation manual, which will lay out all of the procedures\nfor the operation of that mission.

The biggest first step, whenever you're\ndoing remote sensing is determining what type of product and what\ntype of data you want to use. There's typically commercial products,\nwhich are high spatial resolution and then there's the public data,\nwhich is a lower spatial resolution, but typically covers a much larger area. So the first thing you need to decide is\nwhat type of detail do you want to extract? And are you going after individual\nbuildings, or you're going after changes in urban areas, or you're\nlooking at individual farms or you're looking at changes in a forest or\nchanges in agricultural areas. And so that starts to determine\nwhether or not you use commercial, the high resolution data, or do you use the\npublicly available lower resolution data? That level of detail provided\nby high resolution imagery is not achieved by any\npublic satellite data set yet. is not achieved by any\npublic satellite data set yet.

That may change down the road, but right\nnow there's still a very large gap you know, literally a scale of a hundred, between the size of the\npixel in commercial imagery and the size of the pixel that would be in\nthe Sentinel-2 image at 10 meter resolution. With the commercial data, the\nbig thing is always cost and also processing because once you have a\nlarge number of images that you need to put together for\nthe commercial datasets, it becomes a lot more\ndifficult to process. Also the availability, some of the\ncommercial data has recently been launched and hasn't\nbeen up for many years. And so this is the thing that you need\nto think about if you're doing a project or, you know, you come up with an idea is, you\nknow, how far back in time do you want to go? What size areas are you covering? Many countries will simply not be able to afford\ncollection of high resolution satellite imagery. Using publicly available satellite imagery also\nmeans that the project will be more sustainable. Some of the satellites have been\ncollecting data since the 1970s, and this means that all of this data is\nconstantly available for time series analysis.",

So, we have a whole range of different\nwavelengths that we can sense and detect and combine in various ways\nto capture condition and change in a much more effective way than we\ncould with commercial imagery. They're both always going\nto be used hand in hand. We can also fuse other sources\nof data with satellite imagery. So taking all the satellite data together with\nmobile phone data maybe social media tweets. Fuse everything together and tell an\neven more precise and accurate story. There are many things that satellite\ndata cannot tell us, and it will be irresponsible to interpret the\ndata to assume something. I think that this is the most important thing to\nunderstand the limitations and to be very cautious. There's no template for communities\nthat are affected by disaster.

But our ability to document those through\nsatellite imagery are totally different. Another thing that is very important\nis always do validation. Always do accuracy assessment. A really important aspect of that is\nhaving local collaborators, local actors, regional actors who know the situation\nmuch better than we would through remote observation that can give\nus critical insights into whether what we're seeing with satellite imagery\nor geospatial data align with their knowledge of what's happening on\nthe ground at this specific community.

And there have been successful pilots where\nbased on someone's mobile footprint, it was determined whether or not they\nwere eligible for a cash transfer. Low penetration rates in some FCV countries\nin, in some low-middle income countries actually make it harder to use it, to\nleverage it for the work that we do. I focused most of my work in use of CDR\ndata because it's more representative. even though there are still parts\nof the population that are not included. even though there are still parts\nof the population that are not included, and so it is important\nto remember that. But it still has much higher\ncoverage than working with GPS data where you may have\ngood coverage of urban areas, but then especially as you start\nthinking about rural areas, there might be very low coverage. So the main considerations\nwhen it comes to data quality when you're working with call detail\nrecords or this sort of aggregated data, is how closely it corresponds to\npopulation-level observables, because there's always going to\nbe a bias as to who owns these phones, who's using these phones.",

That bias, we found tends to skew more\ntowards men, more towards a younger, more urban, more educated population. The way we adjust for this is we use\nchecks based on representative data, such as censuses or national\nsurveys, and we then calibrate it, and we use sampling weights then maybe give\nmore weight to certain observations over others. In the FCV context, one of the really\nimportant pieces is the privacy aspect and the concerns around ensuring\nthat these data are used safely and does not put any\nindividual or group at risk. We encrypt the data in a way\nthat can't be then deciphered because we don't need to be\nable to reverse engineer that. So we use one-way encryption,\none-way hashes to then secure the anonymization of the individual.\u00a0 As an additional layer of protection,\nwe then aggregate the data. So we take these individual outcomes, and\nbecause what we care about is patterns, we then aggregate it up\nto the cell tower level or to an administrative level that we're\nlooking at, and then we look at trends.",

And that means that when\nwe release this data, when we release these analytics,\nshowing these trends, there\u2019s no way of tracing\nthat back to the individual. Oftentimes, we think more\nabout the personal privacy, but I think in FCV contexts, that group\nprivacy is quite important as well. Oftentimes, people are very\nmuch grouped geographically in terms of based on ethnicity, religion,\nother characteristics. And so with this data, you may also\nbe able to identify, for example, marginalized groups,\nidentify their movement. And so you need to\nbe thinking more broadly ensuring that no data is released\nto the government or publicly, or in other ways that may impact\neither individuals or groups.

There are still not many\npartnerships between providers, governments, international\norganizations like the bank, and we need to keep working on that to strengthen\nthose partnerships for data sharing, for analysis.

These technologies are really easy to deploy. They are affordable, they are easily scalable and you don't\nneed to be an ICT expert to use mobile data collection. Using mobile phones, which is called CAPI,\ncomputer assisted personal interviews, the process is a little bit different because\nthe questionnaire is not printed anymore. It's coded digitally and then transmitted\noften over the cloud into the tablet. And then the tablet is used to collect the data, which also\nmeans that the tablets can already flag certain inconsistencies and can support the enumerator, for example,\nin complying with certain validation patterns. The CAPI programming could actually address\nquite a lot of data quality control measures and the data quality could be improved\nsignificantly through the programming of it. It allows you to implement much more\nsophisticated questionnaire designs. And this means, for example, more sophisticated\nskipping patterns where certain questions are asked to certain respondents, depending\non, for example, previous answers. And that's not something that an\nenumerator has to decide on, but it's automatically done\nin the phone or in the tablet.

There's a lot of innovation, or space for innovation,\nin using mobile phones for data collection. You can use the mobile phone to record\nvideos, video testimonials of respondents, which gives you a complement to the very quantitative\ndata, with a sort of like a qualitative element. It also gives voice to the respondents\nthat they can actually really share what they want to share outside\nthis very structured questionnaire. So we've seen in South Sudan and Somalia that this can\nbe a very powerful way of giving voice often to the poor.

Enumerators in a traditional survey are usually\nnot from that particular village or the town. So when an enumerator goes to a conflict-affected\nregion to collect data, it is flagged by the neighbors. So it becomes a threat to the enumerators. We do try to leverage the fact that locals have\nbetter access and are better able to navigate the fluid security situation on the ground, which is why there's been a big push towards really\ntraining locals to provide this sort of data collection. Then they can administer these with, I'm not\ngoing to say no risk to their own person, but because they are embedded in the communities,\nthey are better able to navigate those risks.

Good afternoon and good evening to all those\u00a0\nconnecting from Europe, Central Asia, and beyond. A warm welcome to everyone. And speaking of warmth, I am\u00a0\nspeaking to you today from an office in a warm, well-heated building\u00a0\nin downtown Washington, but the same sadly cannot be said for\u00a0\nhundreds of thousands of people in the region. As we meet today, many families in Europe and\u00a0\nCentral Asia are fearing the start of the winter. They're concerned about whether they\u00a0\nwill be able to pay their energy bills, stay warm, have enough fuel supply\u00a0\nto last them through the winter. They're also worried that air\u00a0\npollution, which is a silent killer, claims over 300,000 lives\u00a0\nin the region, every year. Unfortunately, heating systems\u00a0\nin the countries in the Europe and Central Asia region are not sustainable. They're expensive, inefficient, polluting and\u00a0\ninadequate for the needs of people and businesses. Therefore, this sector needs\u00a0\na complete transformation.

We at the World Bank believe that\u00a0\nthis transformation is an imperative that requires both political will\u00a0\nand our collective commitment. The region needs to adopt policies that are\u00a0\nbold and government programs that are ambitious, with targeted subsidies for cleaner and\u00a0\nmore efficient heating technologies. I am delighted that among our panelists today, we have one such inspiring example from\u00a0\nthe Clean Air Priority Program from Poland, which is a very ambitious,\u00a0\nsustainable heating program in Europe. I\u2019m glad that we will hear about it. While this transition may be costly,\u00a0\nthe benefit far outweighs the cost. In fact, we estimate that the economic value\u00a0\u00a0 of the transition in today's\u00a0\ndollar is over $400 billion, which are very significant returns.

It is about reshaping the energy landscapes, and it offers prospects of avoiding emissions\u00a0\nequivalent to 8.9 gigatons of carbon dioxide from building related space heating by 2050. Yet, the transition required a massive\u00a0\nshift and a profound transformation in institution, systems, fuels, and technologies. It requires enabling policies,\u00a0\u00a0 increased financing, and better\u00a0\nbusiness models and communications. It requires a heavy lift from countries, the\u00a0\ndevelopment partners and the private sector. But the good news is that we\u00a0\nbelieve this is achievable. The report outlines a framework\u00a0\nfor governments to adopt, to structure their transition plans'\u00a0\neffectiveness and focusing on energy efficiency, district heating improvements and\u00a0\nclean individual heating systems.

Heating has indeed been one of the\u00a0\nmore difficult sectors to abate. We started this report back in late 2021\u00a0\nand completed the report earlier this year with the generous support from the Energy\u00a0\nSector Management Assistance program. The report is available on\u00a0\nour website for download, and we're only going to do a\u00a0\nquick snapshot from the report, but in the report you can find quite a few\u00a0\nfacts and figures and charts and graphs on the status of heating and\u00a0\non the potential transition.

What I'd like to cover during\u00a0\nthe few minutes we have today is why the status quo for\u00a0\nheating is not sustainable, what some of the opportunities for\u00a0\nimprovement and investment are, the costs and benefits of the transition, and then the World Bank's proposed\u00a0\nframework for tackling this transition. As everybody in the region will know very well,\u00a0\nEurope and Central Asia or ECA as we call it, is the coldest region in the world, temperatures\u00a0\ncan get bitterly cold in many parts of the region. As a result of that, about 24% of the\u00a0\nenergy use in the region is for heating, which gets back to what Charles said, that\u00a0\nif we want to decarbonize the energy sector, we can't really do that without\u00a0\ntackling the heating sector. One of the biggest challenges is actually\u00a0\nnot the heating itself, but the buildings. The buildings are quite old. A majority of\u00a0\nthe buildings are over 40 or 50 years old, and because of that, they consume about two\u00a0\nto three times more than the counterparts, for example, in Western Europe. That's even though energy\u00a0\nuse per capita is quite low, but the energy use per square meter is high just\u00a0\nbecause of the inefficiencies of the buildings. The heat itself comes largely\u00a0\nfrom fossil fuels, about 83%.",

That's even though energy\u00a0\nuse per capita is quite low, but the energy use per square meter is high just\u00a0\nbecause of the inefficiencies of the buildings. The heat itself comes largely\u00a0\nfrom fossil fuels, about 83%. That includes district heating and\u00a0\nindividual boiler and heating systems, and another 14% from unsustainable biomass. If you look at the chart here, where we've\u00a0\ndisaggregated electricity and district heating, you can see a lot of black, which is coal\u00a0\ngray, which is gas, and brown, which is wood. Really it requires the transformation of just\u00a0\nabout the entire sector in every country. Because of that, CO2 emissions of the region,\u00a0\nabout 22% are from the heating sector. Quite significant. As Antonella said, not only\u00a0\nis there a greenhouse gas emissions challenge, but it's also highly polluting locally, generating\u00a0\nin winter months, 80 to 90%, sometimes of pm, 2.5, so significant air pollution\u00a0\ncausing over 300,000 deaths a year, and an annual welfare cost of over $300 billion. All of this dependence on fossil fuel\u00a0\ncreates a huge problem for energy security. As we saw only two painfully last\u00a0\nyear, the risk of energy security, global energy, price fluctuations, supply\u00a0\ndisruptions, all have a huge, huge impact on the countries in the region and\u00a0\nmore importantly on the households that are trying to keep their homes warm.

That's something we really\u00a0\ndon't want to see going forward. Despite that, fossil fuel subsidies\u00a0\nin the region were quite high, almost over about 115\u00a0\nbillion according to the IMF. Because of the combination of high prices, very\u00a0\ninefficient supply and very inefficient buildings, a majority, about one third of\u00a0\nhouseholds were energy poor. That means they spent 10%\u00a0\nor more income on energy. Most of that is heating. If you just look at\u00a0\nthe two slides below, if you look on the left, these are most of the homes that we deal with. Old windows, no insulation,\u00a0\ncoal or wood heating, a boiler. They can spend over $2,500\u00a0\na year in heating costs. But if we can imagine for a moment\u00a0\nwe're able to renovate these homes, put new windows on, put solar\u00a0\npanels and an efficient heat pump, we can bring the costs really close to zero.

Although it's not cheap, the cost to\u00a0\nrenovate is probably about $35,000 per home. If we're able to find a way to finance that,\u00a0\nthe potential benefits could be substantial. In our analysis, we looked at both district\u00a0\nheating and individual heating systems. For district heating, we did an assessment of 18. We just sampled 18 utilities to\u00a0\nsee how they were performing. We looked at about five to seven operational\u00a0\nand financial key performance indicators. The results, despite decades of investment\u00a0\nand decades of improvement, were not great. Only about three of the 18 had good\u00a0\nfinancial and operational performance. Eight did well in one area but not in the\u00a0\nother, and seven had poor performance, both financial and operational performance. If we're going to invest the billions of dollars\u00a0\nneeded to upgrade and clean these systems, we need a sea change in terms of the\u00a0\ngovernance structures, the pricing, and the performance of these district heating\u00a0\u00a0 utilities.

We also looked across six countries,\u00a0\nboth rural and urban homes, both single family and multifamily buildings, just to get a sense of how they fared\u00a0\nin terms of what fuels they were using, what types of energy heating systems,\u00a0\nand how efficient the buildings were. In urban areas, we saw mainly\u00a0\ndistrict heating, electricity and gas. In rural areas, we saw mainly wood and coal. When we did economic and financial\u00a0\nanalyses, we found that in urban areas it was really air-to-air heat pumps that\u00a0\ntended to have the least economic costs. In rural homes, the heat pumps did fare well,\u00a0\nbut because their upfront cost is quite high, we also recommended Ecodesign\u00a0\nwood or pellet stoves as well. Most of these analyses really\u00a0\ncame down to two factors. One is the pricing, mostly on the\u00a0\nprice of coal, the price of wood, which is very, very low in some countries, which made the financial analysis show\u00a0\nthat they were quite cost-effective despite the air quality and emission costs. The other thing was whether or\u00a0\nnot the home has internal piping, because it's a little bit more challenging to go\u00a0\u00a0 from air-to-air heat pumps\u00a0\nto a water-based system,",

But there's a lot of great options available. On the left side, you see some of the options\u00a0\nthat are being employed for district heating, waste, heat, biomass, geothermal, are\u00a0\namong the ones most commonly used. But we also see a lot of pilots in\u00a0\nterms of waste and biomass gasification and waste incineration and in solar. There's also a lot of technologies, of\u00a0\ncourse heat pumps we've talked about. These are large heat pumps that\u00a0\nconnected district heating systems, low temperature district heating,\u00a0\nheat storage and other things. Some countries are even now using their\u00a0\nheating system during the summer months to provide district cooling as a way to amortize\u00a0\nthese very, very large infrastructure costs. On the right side, you see individual heating. We talked about air-to-air, also\u00a0\nair-to-water heat pumps are a great option. Geothermal heat pumps, eco wood\u00a0\nstoves and condensing gas boilers. There's still some areas where this still\u00a0\ncame out as the least economic cost.

There's still some areas where this still\u00a0\ncame out as the least economic cost. However, we put a little asterisk there to say\u00a0\nthat gas needs to be used very, very judiciously and only as a transition fuel to a\u00a0\nlonger term decarbonization plan. We can't forget thermal renovations\u00a0\nthat are extremely important, not only to reduce the amount of energy used, but also to make the heating bills\u00a0\nmore affordable for the homeowners. We estimated the cost of the transition,\u00a0\nand I won't lie, the costs are not low. It came to about two to two and a half\u00a0\ntrillion dollars for the transition. But if it's broken out by sub-region, about half\u00a0\nof this cost is the Russian Federation alone. If we exclude that, now, we're talking about\u00a0\njust over a trillion dollars of investment. But the important thing, as Antonella mentioned,\u00a0\u00a0 is the economic benefits\u00a0\nstrongly outweigh the costs. Despite these costs, the economic net\u00a0\npresent value is over $400 billion, and it has a positive rate of return just due\u00a0\nto all of the enormous benefits that accrue. If we just take this number in perspective, if we assume that the subsidies on fossil\u00a0\nfuels that the ECA countries are spending now, if they continue spending that through 2050, then the cost of the transition\u00a0\nis only about half of the money\u00a0\u00a0",

Just putting that in perspective a little\u00a0\nbit, what do governments need to do? Well, there's a number of barriers specific to\u00a0\nheating, multi-jurisdictional responsibilities. This spans just about every\u00a0\nministry and every agency. Unregulated markets for solid fuels,\u00a0\nuneven access to infrastructure. Some homes don't have access to district\u00a0\nheating, they don't have access to gas, and then they're faced with more limited choices. We talked about the indoor piping,\u00a0\nand then just a lack of suppliers and a lack of supply chains to be able to provide\u00a0\nall of these goods and services that are needed. What we've seen based on experience from other\u00a0\ncountries is you really need a mix of reforms. We talk a lot about energy pricing, but\u00a0\nit's also things like certifying biomass that we can make sure that the biomass\u00a0\nis harvested and used sustainably. Energy efficiency codes and standards,\u00a0\u00a0 air quality regulations, all of\u00a0\nthese things are really important.

The benefits I mentioned are substantial,\u00a0\nmore efficient building stock, reduced energy poverty, more affordable\u00a0\nheating, energy independence. The benefits are really, really quite substantial. We would love to see our client\u00a0\ncountries accrue these great benefits. Finally, how did our framework\u00a0\nlay out in the report? We felt there was three main pillars to what\u00a0\ncountries could do to achieve this transition. The first is reducing demand\u00a0\nthrough energy efficiency in\u00a0\u00a0 the building sector, this is critically important. We found that we could reduce heating demand\u00a0\nby 50 to 55% just through energy efficiency. If you do the energy efficiency measures first,\u00a0\nwe can reduce the transition costs by about half. About one to $2 trillion could be reduced if we\u00a0\u00a0 just reduce heating demand.\u00a0\nAnd countries are there.

The second is on district\u00a0\nheating. We think district\u00a0\u00a0 heating can be a tremendous value to clients. In Western Europe, they do extremely well. There's no subsidies that go in the district\u00a0\nheating, and many of them are much, much cleaner, but they need to significantly\u00a0\nbe able to improve performance, and they need to be viable even if heating\u00a0\ndemand goes down by a significant amount. We need to find cleaner sources for\u00a0\nthe district heating, as I mentioned, whether it's waste, heat, geothermal and other. Finally, for the individual heating systems,\u00a0\u00a0 which is the majority that have\u00a0\njust a building level boiler, we need to find more efficient\u00a0\nheating systems and much cleaner fuels and be able to provide financing\u00a0\npackages, behavior campaigns, training, and all of the things necessary to allow\u00a0\nthe market to be able to serve this sector.

Thank you for that. For all of you who are interested in the report,\u00a0\nas Jas said, it's available on the website, and you can get the link and download a\u00a0\nvery thorough and well-thought-out report.

Let me first turn to St\u00e9phanie Bouckaert,\u00a0\nwho's the head of the Demand Sectors unit of the World Energy Outlook\u00a0\nat the International Agency. St\u00e9phanie, I think the International\u00a0\nEnergy Agency has been for many years sounding the charge that we need to do,\u00a0\nthe first fuel is energy efficiency, and we've heard that again from Jas this morning, but somehow the countries don't\u00a0\nseem to be getting that message. But we heard from Jas as well that if\u00a0\ncountries did energy efficiency at scale, the cost of transition would be reduced by $1\u00a0\ntrillion. He said $1 trillion to $2 trillion. That's huge, huge savings. On top of that, if the region\u00a0\nelectrified its heating sector,",

Over to you. Thank you. [Antonella Bassani]\nThank you very much\u00a0\u00a0 for the question and thanks for\u00a0\ninviting me to this live event. It's great to see this report on space\u00a0\nheating because as it was rightly said, indeed it's crucial to find\u00a0\nsolutions for sustainable heating,\u00a0\u00a0 not only for this region but globally, because this space heating\u00a0\nis really the largest source\u00a0\u00a0 of energy demand in the building sector globally, accounting for one third of\u00a0\nbuilding's energy demand, and accounting for 5% of global\u00a0\nenergy related CO2 emissions,\u00a0\u00a0 so from the combustion within buildings. Worldwide, I think around 40% of households\u00a0\nrequire space heating at some time in the year.",

With the heating being a major\u00a0\ncomponent of home energy expenditures, which was clearly highlighted with\u00a0\nthese cases in the presentation. Particularly in colder climates\u00a0\nsuch as within this region. As we have seen from the presentation,\u00a0\nbut it is the case also globally, heating still relies heavily on fossil\u00a0\nfuels, in particular natural gas, which contribute today to around\u00a0\n60% of space heating service demand, and electricity today accounts for around 20%. A lower share in terms of meeting\u00a0\nservice demand for space heating. In the scenarios that we are producing a\u00a0\nDIE, so we have three different scenarios, one which is based on the current policy\u00a0\nenvironment and a more ambitious one, which is the net-zero by 2050 scenario. Electricity meets two thirds of the\u00a0\nservice demand for space heating by 2050. We see indeed a big role for\u00a0\nelectrification within the building sectors. In terms of policy, so indeed maps and building\u00a0\nenergy codes are really key policy tools to enhance the de-efficiency\u00a0\nof heating in buildings.

Now when it comes to electric\u00a0\nheating and heat pumps specifically, we have seen also that the\u00a0\nglobal energy crisis in 2022 brought risk to heating energy\u00a0\nsecurity and affordability, but has also led to unprecedented momentum for\u00a0\ntransition away from fossil fuel-based heating.

        "excerpt": "Really, within this scenario, we\u00a0\nsee that if all the governments meet their announced emerging\u00a0\nclimate related commitments, then heat pumps will serve already as the primary\u00a0\u00a0 means of the decarbonizing\u00a0\nspace and water heating. But the deployment of heat\u00a0\npumps, as this was highlighted, also needs to come with strategic\u00a0\npolicy incentives to promote retrofit, and efficient building envelopes as\u00a0\nwell as demand side response measures. Also, to ensure that heat pumps doesn't\u00a0\nput a strain on the [inaudible] sector through increased electricity\u00a0\ndemand, especially during peak hours. Households that add a heat pump without\u00a0\nimproving efficiency in parallel could of course see their peak\u00a0\ndemand during winter months tripping, which could also have an effect on their bills\u00a0\nand would not lower their household expenditures. Higher efficiency envelopes will also lower\u00a0\nupfront and operating costs for consumers. Using heat pumps, given that they will reduce\u00a0\nthe capacity of the heat pump required, as you will have a more insulated household. Currently, we see that most of\u00a0\nthe installation of heat pumps are concentrated in new buildings\u00a0\nand existing single-family homes.

Great to have you on the panel.\u00a0\nLet me then turn to Matthieu Ballu, who's the Policy Officer of the\u00a0\nDirector General for Energy, Renewable Energy Unit at the European Commission. Matthieu, there's no doubt that the EU has\u00a0\nbeen leading the charge on sustainable heating as evidenced by the recent announcement\u00a0\nto further strengthen the obligation for member states to increase the share of\u00a0\nheating and cooling from renewable energy sources. I think your target now is 1.3% per year,\u00a0\nif I'm not mistaken, for every year. Will this be enough to decarbonize\u00a0\nthe heating sector by mid-century? I have a second question to follow up. We've heard from Stephanie all of\u00a0\nyour targets on the heat pumps, but just turning back to district heating, I just wondered whether since Europe\u00a0\nreally depends on district heating,\u00a0\u00a0 which is harder to decarbonize,",

Thank you. [Matthieu Ballu]\nThank you Charles. Hello everyone, and big thanks to Jas and team for the great\u00a0\nreport and the opportunity to discuss now. Indeed, big changes recently at EU level. This month, the EU member states and\u00a0\nparliament agreed on the revision of the main piece of EU\u00a0\nlegislation on renewable energy and renewable heating and cooling\u00a0\nis at the core of this revision. We heard some numbers already, but heating and cooling overall represents\u00a0\nabout half of the energy consumed in the EU, and more than 70% of that\u00a0\nis still from fossil origin. Even if you look at the renewable parts,\u00a0\nmore than 80% of that is still biomass. There's still a need for diversification and\u00a0\nincreased deployment of renewable energy there, which despite our progress\u00a0\non renewable energy overall, and despite the fact that we exceeded\u00a0\nour 2020 targets for renewables, we have not yet managed to crack that one. Part of the objective of that\u00a0\nrevision is to address this.",

Part of the objective of that\u00a0\nrevision is to address this. There is a new overall renewable\u00a0\ntarget for the EU that has been agreed of 42.5% of renewable energy in the overall\u00a0\nenergy consumption of the EU by 2030. It's twice today's share and\u00a0\ntwice the ambition that we had for the current decade under\u00a0\nthe previous legislation. We\u00a0\u00a0 are really looking at massive acceleration. This is across all sectors. For\u00a0\nheating and cooling specifically, the main change is that for the first\u00a0\ntime, there will be a binding target for renewable heating and\u00a0\ncooling for all member states. About half of the yearly\u00a0\nincreased share will be mandatory. On top of that, there are national top-ups\u00a0\naligned with our long-term de-carbonization goal, which amount to about 1.8 percentage\u00a0\npoints per year of increase, which is two to three times the increase rates\u00a0\nthat we have seen over the past 10 years. We are really looking at a very strong\u00a0\nacceleration there, a strong signal to investors. Next to this overall target for\u00a0\nrenewable heating and cooling, a set of other targets that are complimentary. For instance, a new target for the\u00a0\nrenewable energy used in buildings,",

An increased target for renewables in\u00a0\ndistrict heating, I'll come back to that one. One for renewables used in industry,\u00a0\nwhich also overlaps and compliments and strengthens the one on heating and cooling. Next to those targets, the\u00a0\nrenewable energy directive, the new revised law adds a whole new\u00a0\ntoolbox of measures for member states. Some of them that were already available,\u00a0\nsome others like a new strengthened definition for heat purchase agreements that will\u00a0\nreally help find new business models and help member states to find the best way to\u00a0\ngo about de-carbonization heat in their country. This legislation is not standalone, it's part\u00a0\nof an overall effort that the EU has done in the past years to align the ambition\u00a0\nand the tools of our legislation with a trajectory for our\u00a0\nlong-term de-carbonization.

Then specifically about district heating\u00a0\nand cooling. There are two main aspects. One is our legislation on renewable\u00a0\nenergy, which has this increased target, but also provisions to support the participation\u00a0\nof district heating and cooling systems in the integrated energy systems of tomorrow.

Of course, this is not only something\u00a0\nthat we're doing within the EU, but we are working with our neighbors. We work, for instance, with the energy community on the implementation of EU\u00a0\nlegislation in Eastern Europe.

As you rightly mentioned Charles, our major\u00a0\nenergy resource is a natural gas so far, and only for heating purposes. For Tashkent City alone, we spent $1\u00a0\nbillion cubic meters of gas annually, and the oil consumption of the\u00a0\npopulation of gas, of natural gas, reached $12 billion cubic meters of natural gas, which is very expensive and inefficient\u00a0\nuse of this valuable resource. We fortunately cannot be that proud\u00a0\nthat as colleagues from the EU, which work very comprehensively tackling the\u00a0\nenergy efficiency issue through all angles. But nevertheless, we did some progress. First of all, by building up our power\u00a0\ngeneration capacity is based on renewables. Second, we started working, to talk\u00a0\nabout the heating in particular, we started introducing co-generation units, which for sure are more efficient than\u00a0\ntraditional way of heating houses and buildings.

But before I move on to the\u00a0\nClean Air Priority Program, I would like to just reflect in a few\u00a0\nwords on what previous speakers said. Specifically that improving air quality\u00a0\nand energy efficiency of buildings does not only entail single family buildings,\u00a0\u00a0 but if we speak about the\u00a0\ncarbonization of the economy, the professional energy sector is also important. Polish government dedicates\u00a0\nspecial programs to this issue, including funds from the modernization funds.

Today, however, I would like to\u00a0\nfocus on the Clean Air Program. It has been implemented since September 2018 and the great advantage of this\u00a0\nprogram is its comprehensiveness. It is often called an anti-smoke program, so one could think that it is only\u00a0\nabout the heat source replacement, but this is not just the program of\u00a0\nreplacement of the so-called smoke belchers, the low efficiency equipment,\u00a0\nbut also from the very beginning it involved improving energy efficiency\u00a0\nof buildings and thermal retrofits. Even then in 2018, ahead of the trend, because even then we realized that\u00a0\nbesides removing the smoke belchers, thermal retrofit of the\u00a0\nbuilding is very important. Recently, we have celebrated five\u00a0\nyears of the program's implementation and given its comprehensiveness and the budget, because a budget of 103 billion Polish zlotys\u00a0\nand the comprehensive nature of the program means that it must be continually adjusted.

And of course, I'm not even\u00a0\nmentioning the February of\u00a0\u00a0 last year when Russia attacked Ukraine. The program has undergone a number of\u00a0\nreforms and has been gradually changed. The reforms started in May, 2020. The program\u00a0\nwas completely rearranged, restructured. The new structure involves\u00a0\nthree levels of financing. Of course, the program is based on\u00a0\nsubsidies that the beneficiaries receive. It is intended to incentivize\u00a0\nthem to invest in their building and to insulate it and replace the heat source. Now the investment program\u00a0\nis divided into three parts.

We have created information\u00a0\ndesks at municipal offices and the beneficiaries can go\u00a0\nand receive information there. They may also receive assistance\u00a0\nin filling in the application. They can also file the application there. 86% of all local governments in Poland\u00a0\nparticipate in implementation of the program. The vast majority of municipalities\u00a0\njoined the implementation. This is certainly a factor in\u00a0\nincreasing accessibility of the program.

I will describe the changes in a moment,\u00a0\nbut as a result of those changes, our beneficiaries are happy\u00a0\nto participate in the program. First of all, we have increased the amount of\u00a0\nsubsidy that can be achieved under the program. Now one beneficiary may get\u00a0\nas much as 136,200 zlotys to replace the smoke belcher and to\u00a0\nincrease energy efficiency of the building.

We have a separate track for those who\u00a0\ndo not have their own money upfront and they can use for a Clean Air loan, they can\u00a0\napply for a Clean Air loan in a commercial bank. Our subsidy can be used towards\u00a0\npayment of the principle of the loan. It's a loan that includes the subsidy component and there's a lot of participants\u00a0\nwho like to take that loan. In 2022, for example, we have also\u00a0\nlaunched a pre-financing mechanism because in general this is\u00a0\nrefinancing or retro financing, you have to pay upfront and then you\u00a0\nget reimbursed by way of a subsidy. But on top of that, there is a pre-financing. Half of the subsidy can be disbursed\u00a0\nbefore the project is started under the condition that the contract with a\u00a0\ncontractor has been signed for the project. That's all about the Clean Air Program. Now let me just tell you that\u00a0\nso far throughout the program, 711,000 applications have been supplied\u00a0\nfor 19,000,000,00, 19 billion PLN.

[Charles Cormier]\nThank you, Pawe\u0142.\u00a0\u00a0 I think we can hear the passion of\u00a0\nthe program into your intervention and if I understood you correctly, one of the\u00a0\nsuccesses is that there's a very targeted subsidy and well-designed subsidy, but a\u00a0\nhuge response from the population. That's interesting to hear. I\u00a0\nwanted to open up the floor to... This is a live event and we've had a couple\u00a0\u00a0 of hundred people following\u00a0\nus on different social media and I wanted to open up the floor\u00a0\nto some questions and answers. I'm getting them from my colleagues in Washington, and one of the questions we've\u00a0\nbeen asked from the audience is, \"Essentially, what are the incentives\u00a0\nfor the private sector to come in to support sustainable heating solutions\u00a0\nand is it a matter of let's say, working through the consumers to convince them?\" And I wondered whether\u2026 I wanted to maybe\u00a0\nask St\u00e9phanie and Matthieu to come back",

On the private sectors, indeed, there is a\u00a0\nneed for governments to send the right signals in terms of policy to ensure that they can\u00a0\nfollow up with the planned supply chains. I think is something that we\u00a0\nsee now on the heat pump side that indeed there was a big boom in terms\u00a0\nof sales of heat pumps and a big expansion. But at the same time now the private sectors, heat pump suppliers are a bit\u00a0\nscared of having over capacity because the demand is a bit lagging\u00a0\nnow. There was a big momentum, but now we need to ensure that demand is there. I think there is a big need\u00a0\nfor policy makers to ensure\u00a0\u00a0 that we have the right signals on the demand side to ensure that then the private sectors\u00a0\ncan follow with the supply chains and making sure that all these\u00a0\nheat pumps that are available now",

[Charles Cormier]\nGreat, thank you.\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you St\u00e9phanie. Matthieu, do\u00a0\nyou have anything to add to that? [Matthieu Ballu]\nYes. What I can\u00a0\u00a0 add is that indeed, on the manufacturing side, working on the supply chain as\u00a0\nwell is essential in general. Simplification and giving clear signals,\u00a0\nbut also the issue of permitting. Eliminating all the bottlenecks and allowing\u00a0\u00a0 developers to really be able\u00a0\nto understand from the outset how complex and how long the authorization period\u00a0\nwill take is essential for bigger projects, of course, but also for smaller\u00a0\nsolutions. Creating new business models. I mentioned, for instance, the rewarding\u00a0\nof flexibility services for instance. Allowing heating systems to\u00a0\nparticipate in energy markets is an alternative way to create business models, and in general visibility and predictability of\u00a0\nthe support schemes is very important as well.

One other\u00a0\nperson in the audience, a couple of people, were asking the question about affordability.\u00a0\u00a0 We heard upfront from Jaz\u00a0\nthat from the consumer side, economy wide is expensive for the consumer side. There are ways to reduce the cost, but how would you think about making sure\u00a0\nthat the energy transition is affordable? I don't know if Pawe\u0142 wants to\u00a0\ntake that or maybe Shukhrat?

With many programs that we have kicked off,\u00a0\u00a0 whether for individual customers\u00a0\nor for group customers, the subsidies we have in the program, they kind of distort the market because\u00a0\nthey don't have to be paid back. the prices of appliances equipment are\u00a0\nincreased when a subsidy comes into play. That's how the market responds. When there is increasing demand for a technology that is subsidized from one\u00a0\nor another support program, what that does is that the industry will quickly\u00a0\ntake this unfortunate decision to put the price up and the end beneficiary has to pay\u00a0\nmore. I think it's unavoidable. It is unavoidable, but without\u00a0\nthe subsidy on the other hand, there is absolutely no way that\u00a0\nthese objectives could be achieved. Look at how much we have accomplished, individual beneficiaries and also\u00a0\ninstitutional beneficiaries too.",

Without this extra support, there's no way\u00a0\nthey would've done all the investments. There's no way they would've\u00a0\ncarried out all the projects. On the other hand, our subsidies, especially\u00a0\nduring the pandemic period in 2021 and 2022, they were such an excellent driver\u00a0\nfor the economy, an excellent engine. When I say economy, it's with a capital E at\u00a0\nthe national scale and also at the local scale. When things were getting tough,\u00a0\nwhen companies were going bankrupt, these billions and billions of subsidies\u00a0\nthat were pushed into the market, they really kept MSMEs alive,\u00a0\nMicro and Small Medium Enterprises, they survived thanks to our\u00a0\nsubsidies. Let me use the\u00a0\u00a0 example of My Electricity where we subsidize PV. Photovoltaic is 1 PLN, like $1 but 1 PLN,\u00a0\ngives us over 6 PLN increase in production.

It's already expected to introduce much\u00a0\nbetter discipline in terms of using energy. Second, we are working now on the\u00a0\nset of energy efficiency measures to be introduced at policy and regulation levels. These policies include the usual suspects, energy audit requirement to reach a\u00a0\ncertain level of energy efficiency in using energy consuming equipment,\u00a0\nintroduction of certain standards and using our universal smart metering system\u00a0\nin the power sector to better manage demand, especially in very cold and very hot seasons. Along with that, we're moving to modernization\u00a0\nof our district heating facilities and replacing all soviet\u00a0\ntime built large facilities, which spend almost 60% of heat\u00a0\ngenerated for heating the streets. We're replacing them with\u00a0\nsmaller compact heating units which provide services for the smallest\u00a0\nnumber of apartment buildings and houses, but with much less losses.

I may not sound very modest, but I do\u00a0\nbelieve that the result of our success is absence of cannibalization of programs.

Fiji, one of the largest countries\nin the Pacific islands, is striving to become a world-class\ntrade hub to drive economic growth. To achieve this, Fiji with support from the World Bank,\nhas introduced bold trade facilitation reforms to improve efficiency\nand create greater prosperity for all. We cannot produce everything on our own.\n  We need to be driven by a value proposition and efficiency. So it's very important\nthat trade facilitation and all the stakeholders\nthat are connected through trade facilitation supply chains function efficiently. To lead the reforms, a National Trade Facilitation Committee was created jointly with government and business representatives, critically bringing both sets\nof stakeholders to the table. The National Trade Facilitation\nCommittee is all about driving innovation it involves the whole of government\nand particularly our integrated agencies on the border. So obviously biosecurity,\nthe police, the airport staff, health department and others,\nwe really need an integrated approach to how we make trade safe and secure,\nbut as easy as possible. The committee developed a plan\nto automate the cargo manifest system, which lists all goods being carried by ship.",

Traditionally, these were prepared as a paper document, and multiple copies were provided\nin different formats to port authorities and various agencies. Before I used to receive hard copies in bunches. It was quite hectic, and I have to go\npage by page. To tackle this, a single automated manifest was introduced\nusing the global standardized, Automated System for Customs Data - ASYCUDA. At the initial stage, we had all the agencies coming into Fiji Customs \nand then studying our system, how it is working, \nhow manifesting is being done, what is the importance of automation, \nhow simplified the process is. There was a mindset\nthat we need these manual documentations.  But COVID-19 has changed our mindset, and it has brought positiveness in the way that we are working. The automated import system also makes trade facilitation  and food safety requirements much easier and efficient. Together with our colleagues and partners\nin biosecurity, in customs and as well as fisheries,\nwe continue to build on the momentum",

Humbling to see the country's resilience, hope and solidarity after the recent earthquake. And inspiring because Morocco has a clear vision for its future in what it calls the new development model, and the World Bank is proud to be supporting the work that's going into this vision.

        "excerpt": "Welcome to Day 5 of our wrap from the World\nBank \u2013 IMF Annual Meetings. I\u2019m Hatim Otmani bringing you the day\u2019s\nupdates from Marrakech. Today started with a landmark address by the\nWorld Bank President Ajay Banga, where he spoke about how the World Bank will deliver\none its new vision of ending poverty on a livable planet. \"\nWe must be the hand on the back \u2013 moving people forward. We must be an institution that exports optimism\nand impact. But we must change to make good on that promise\nand deliver on what is being demanded. The World Bank is turning to face the wind. That evolution began months ago, and today\nthere is a new vision and mission for the World Bank: To create a world free of poverty\n\u2013 on a livable planet. But even with a better Bank, even with governments,\neven with multilateral institutions, and philanthropies all working together, we are still going to\nfall very far short. We need the scale, the resources, and the\ningenuity of the private sector. There is nothing that gives me more hope than\nour capacity to work together in common purpose. Do not look at the ground, do not fail to\nlift your gaze. If one thing is clear today, it should be\nthat the eyes of the World Bank are fixed on the horizon. Along with increasing the Bank\u2019s financial\ncapacity and deepening its global knowledge,",

Along with increasing the Bank\u2019s financial\ncapacity and deepening its global knowledge, this will require building stronger partnerships. So that\u2019s why I think the whole question\nof a better Bank is about what we were doing for the last couple of decades is not what\nwe need to do now, we need a different response. So different skillsets, different ways of\naddressing support to countries, bringing in partners from the private sector and from\nother important stakeholders. The private sector will be critical to delivering\nsolutions at scale at a time of multiple challenges. There is a lot of capital in the world that\ncould be used to invest to address these challenges. We are estimating $500 trillion dollars worth\nis available out there but we are not significantly investing in developing countries. So what can we do to invest more in developing\ncountries where the governments are facing all these fiscal constraints. It\u2019s been a great week here on the beautiful\nAnnual Meetings Campus.

Now, we just finished a very interesting\u00a0\ndiscussion active, animated, lively, on investing in people for job creation. And the reason for that discussion is that\u00a0\ndeveloping countries face a huge challenge in creating jobs, because there will be\u00a0\none billion people entering the labor force in these countries between now and 2050. And what's clear is that while you need a\u00a0\ncompetitive economy, you need access to finance, you need infrastructure, you\u00a0\nalso need skilled people. Skilled people to engage in productive\u00a0\nactivity and skilled people to create jobs. So, there was a lot of attention on\u00a0\neducation, skills and vocational training, but also, on connecting people to jobs. Because many people are simply not able\u00a0\nto access the jobs that are available. There was also a lot of emphasis on removing\u00a0\nthe barriers that women and young people face in accessing the labor market. There were talks about how to access\u00a0\njobs in the international labor market, not just in the domestic labor market, and last\u00a0\nbut not least, how to support entrepreneurship.

I started my career with an IT Training\u00a0\nCenter in the Northern part of Nigeria, Kano. And after training a lot of IT professionals,\u00a0\nI realized that I'm not changing their lives. They come into the centers, they get trained\u00a0\nin MCSE, Oracle and all these big IT courses, and they go back into the market without a job. I started researching on what I\u00a0\ncould do to create employment. And I was dealing with a lot of\u00a0\nIndians at the time, and I realized that business process outsourcing\u00a0\nprovides millions of jobs to Indians. America has been outsourcing their\u00a0\ncustomer service to India since 1980. And I said, \u201cWhy not Nigeria?\u201d And I started moving towards\u00a0\nestablishing the company. It took me eight years to start the company. I started it four times and failed. But we went live in June 2016, and today\u00a0\nwe are 1500 employees and 50% are women. I need to mention that.

Nigeria graduates are a million graduate\u00a0\nevery year with different skill sets, but they have to be upskilled to be\u00a0\nemployed, to be put on a client's campaign. We put in a structured training, from\u00a0\ncommunication skills to attention to details, to time management, to critical thinking\u00a0\nfor them to be able to be enrolled into a client specific training. This is just before going live\u00a0\ninto the training of a client. I'm going to later talk about\u2026 Do I still have time? I'm going to talk about the\u00a0\ndifferent kinds of trainings.

Today, those lawyers are doing\u00a0\nmuch more than paralegal work. We looked at Accounting also as a service.

I personally received education from\u00a0\npublic schools and universities in Iraq, but I managed to utilize all the resources\u00a0\nthat are available to advance my skills. Back in 2008, I graduated and\u00a0\nI joined the public sector. After one year into working with the government\u00a0\nsector, I'd realized that it's was not my calling, so, I applied for a scholarship. I did my Masters in the US, I came back during\u00a0\nISIS time, the country was going through a difficult time, and I decided that I\u00a0\nwas really passionate about green building and green practices. I started applying for grants multiple times\u00a0\nto go abroad and get professional training in green building practices. And at some point, I decided\u00a0\nto establish my business. I knew I didn't have that kind of practical\u00a0\nexperience in establishing and running a business, but I also realized that experience\u00a0\ncomes from taking action, doing.

Now, we know that human capital is\u00a0\ncritical to economic development, but just how much impact could it actually have? Well, the World Bank estimates that if\u00a0\neveryone was able to achieve their potential through knowledge, skills, and good\u00a0\nhealth, and if more people worked in jobs that made the most of their human capital, we\u00a0\ncould more than triple productivity and income. So, Axel, I want to bring you in here, because\u00a0\ngiven what you've just heard about opportunities at the country level, how is the World Bank\u00a0\ninvesting in human capital for more jobs? [Axel van Trotsenburg]\nWell, I think it comes from two sides. And actually, we have had here at the Annual\u00a0\nMeetings a lot of talk about the reform of multilateral institutions,\u00a0\nabout our new mission. And one of the components of\u00a0\nthe mission is also inclusion, and that is particularly on\u00a0\nhuman development and jobs. And what we see is absolutely essential. We see the potential of\u00a0\nhuman capital, and then jobs. And I just wanted to remind people about this. Fifty or sixty years ago, when we looked at the\u00a0\nworld, including in Asia, there was sometimes a bit of a doom and gloom, and sometimes\u00a0\nyou hear that again these days.",

Fifty or sixty years ago, when we looked at the\u00a0\nworld, including in Asia, there was sometimes a bit of a doom and gloom, and sometimes\u00a0\nyou hear that again these days. A famous Nobel Prize winner, a Swedish\u00a0\neconomist, Gunnar Myrdal, wrote a book about Asian drama, and essentially\u00a0\ncondemned the whole continent. They said, \u201cWell, they will never develop. India or Southeast Asia couldn't feed\u00a0\nthemselves; they couldn't pull themselves out of, they couldn't create jobs, there\u00a0\nwill only be corruption, et cetera.\u201d And now you see where they are today, which\u00a0\nis good not always to rely on economists for their advice. But what is actually essential is the\u00a0\nsystematic investment in human capital, and that is on education, but\u00a0\nultimately in the entire infrastructure. It is not in education that you say, \u201cWell,\u00a0\nwe start there to think about primary, and then maybe secondary.\u201d You need the entire chain. And maybe, actually, starting from\u00a0\nprenatal care to postnatal care, so that these kids get actually fat well. Because, unfortunately, malnutrition is still one\u00a0\nof the main obstacles for kids or young people to get good jobs, because sometimes their\u00a0\nintellectual development is being retarded",

So, we cannot only say, \u201cYou go to\u00a0\nschool,\u201d they need to be well fed. We need to care for them. Even from pre-K, you need to stimulate these kids, and then you can get is\u00a0\nactually fantastic results. One of the things is that, as a society,\u00a0\nwe need to be totally committed to this, but not only in education, at the\u00a0\nbeginning, but we have to continue in secondary, tertiary education. Today, it\u2019s continuous learning. Because today, you no longer have a job and\u00a0\nyou know you will be in the same job forever, you will need to change skills and\u00a0\nthat value chain needs to be created. But what we just heard is also\u00a0\nwe need to believe in people, and particularly we need to believe in women. Ajay mentioned that today at his Annual\u00a0\nMeeting speech, \u201cIt is a bit difficult to deny all the women and girls the\u00a0\nsame rights and possibilities. Actually, we are foregoing economic\u00a0\nwelfare, because so many women are denied",

And also, as societies, there has to be a\u00a0\ndeliberate move towards empowering more women, and then for the younger people. It is not only for young female entrepreneurs,\u00a0\nbut also for all the young entrepreneurs. The possibilities are giving access to credit,\u00a0\naccess to infrastructure, meaning electricity. Keep in mind that in Africa still 600\u00a0\nmillion people have no access to electricity. So, it\u2019s better access to\u00a0\nInternet, digitalization. The younger generations also\u00a0\nneed the toolkit to succeed. And we cannot only see that on education. We need to see the whole part, and I believe\u00a0\nthat very often, this is a problem that we see in one dimension, but it's multidimensional. But I think that what both of you are seeing is\u00a0\nthat there is an incredible potential out there that can transform.

So, what we have done after one year of\u00a0\nproviding customer service and sales, I looked at the different people\u00a0\nthat graduate in Nigeria every year, one million graduates with different skill sets. We can actually serve the world from Nigeria. And I started partnering with\u00a0\nexperts in different professions. We started with software development as a service. And we got a partner in Silicon\u00a0\nValley that created a program. We worked together to create a structured\u00a0\nlearning program that trains our team based on the needs of companies in Silicon Valley. So, there has to be an intentionally\u00a0\nsetting up of the curriculum based on how they're going to be employable,\u00a0\nhow they are going to be employed. We structured that learning and we\u00a0\ntested it, and we outsourced IT, right? And we added data to it, data analysis. And now we've added AI to those\u00a0\nwho are going to work with us.

[Basima Abdulrahman]\nA very sensitive question\u2026 To be honest, we don't see many\u00a0\nwomen in STEM fields in general, not to mention leading companies in\u00a0\nhigh-tech industries, or in STEM fields, or mainly in male dominated sectors. That's not because women are incapable. It's mostly because women get less opportunities\u00a0\nto get into careers in these sectors, and hence, advance and lead these sectors. So, I come from a region, and I think this\u00a0\nis not a regional perspective around women, it's more of a global thing, but I understand\u00a0\nthere is this kind of social biasness towards women working in\u00a0\nhigh-tech engineering sectors. And I've trained myself to understand\u00a0\nit and accept it, because I understand most of the social biasness is unconscious. So, I make sure that I'm always equipped\u00a0\nwith the knowledge, with resources, with innovative ideas to communicate with\u00a0\u00a0 potential investors, with\u00a0\nclients and with partners.",

Then, actually listening to the private\u00a0\nsector, what some of the concerns have been.

And there is a whole range of issues which you\u00a0\nwould need to address to actually fully exploit the potential, for example, of solar\u00a0\npower in Iraq, but also elsewhere. There is, then, the whole area of what the\u00a0\npublic sector can do in terms of creating the infrastructure that is necessary. We've talked earlier on the whole education\u00a0\nchallenges and then there is the question on investments.

Can we actually think of bigger platforms that\u00a0\nare really supporting young entrepreneurs? And I think that is what we need to do. What I find, actually, and I'm very sympathetic\u00a0\nwith this, is that if you travel sometimes in Africa, and I saw that in the Sahel\u00a0\nzone, you\u2019ll have a lot of young people with a lot of ideas and with old equipment. They need a little helping hand. They don't want to have a handout, but they want to have maybe some\u00a0\nrisk capital or electricity. There are some of these conditions.

I think that's a very good question. So, starting from young education,\u00a0\ndigital literacy is really very important. What are the odds of a young woman\u00a0\ngrowing up, born and brought up in Kano, Northern Nigeria, thinking to\u00a0\nserve the world from Nigeria?

It is really important from early age in Africa. I know that in developing countries and\u00a0\ndeveloped countries that is already going on. We need to do more and find a\u00a0\nway to bring in digital literacy into our primary school and early education. Another thing that we really need\u00a0\nto do is, while we are doing that, is that environmental awareness and the way\u00a0\nthat children from early stage should be aware of how to protect the environment, what they need\u00a0\nto do, should also be part of their curriculum. In that way, both technology and environment\u00a0\nare incorporated into the culture of their growing up. So, when you remember the learnings\u00a0\nthat you've heard as a child, those are practices that you do in an\u00a0\nearly stage that get inhabited in you and you actually behave\u00a0\nlike that when you grow up. So that needs to be done. Going into higher institutions, there has\u00a0\nto be a collaboration between the industries and the universities.",

But when you're looking at\u00a0\nlow-hanging fruit right now, how do we create skill development centers? And I think we touched on it earlier. India did that with IT and now they\u00a0\ncreated huge employment in the IT sector around the world. I don't think you can go to any tech\u00a0\ncompanies without seeing a majority, or a very large number, of Indians working there. And this is basically based on the\u00a0\nNational Skill Development Corporation. So that effort alone, that learning, should\u00a0\nbe replicated across countries in Africa.

It's a very important topic considering\u00a0\nthat the solar energy sector is not new, it's been there for 25 years, but globally,\u00a0\nthe development of the sector was very slow.

We are getting a lot of interest from both,\u00a0\ngovernments and from the private sector on this issue. I think there's a recognition, right, that\u00a0\nthe challenge of employment is significant. How can we talk about a sustainable\u00a0\nplanet if people do not have an income to support themselves? So, that's why, as a part of the new\u00a0\nmission statement of the World Bank, we talk about sustainability delivered through\u00a0\ngrowth and human development, including jobs. So, I think there's a recognition that, as\u00a0\nthis planet is threatened, instead of seeing a contradiction between economic growth and\u00a0\nenvironmental sustainability, we have to see these things coming together. You can't really talk about one\u00a0\nwithout talking about the other.

So, I think that's also very positive. Now, obviously, there's a budget envelope that\u00a0\ngovernments have and they have to prioritize. There are a number of tools that we\u00a0\nmake available to governments to use, so that they can prioritize and invest in things\u00a0\nwhich provide the highest return and cut back on things which are harmful. And investing in people provides very high returns and they can find the resources for that by cutting back on the things that don't\u00a0\nprovide a high return and can even be harmful, like subsidies for fossil fuels, programs\u00a0\nthat have not been shown to be effective.

We are very happy to see the private sector\u00a0\nadvocating for more openness to labor mobility and more willingness to partner in skills\u00a0\npartnerships, to engage in skills partnerships. I am biased because I work in this\u00a0\narea, but I do see a lot of momentum around this issue of investing in people to\u00a0\ncreate jobs and have a sustainable planet.

A big thank you to all of our guests for\u00a0\njoining us to discuss this important issue. It's clear from today's session that more\u00a0\nand better investments in people are critical to build human capital and stimulate\u00a0\njob creation, including, importantly, through entrepreneurship. And while countries and the World Bank are\u00a0\nworking to support and develop human capital, it will take cooperation and collaboration\u00a0\nacross all sectors, including the private sector and the civil society, to address this challenge\u00a0\nand, of course, leverage this opportunity. Well, that brings us to the end of this event. We hope it's been informative\u00a0\nand engaging for you. You can watch the replay of this\u00a0\nsession and our other events at live.worldbank.org/annualmeetings.
