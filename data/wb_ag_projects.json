It provides valuable services such as the provision of fish for food products, and key biodiversity and habitats that support tourism, as well as carbon storage. The project's objective will be achieved by financing the countries to collaborate to improve the governance of the use of this shared natural capital asset, establishing an enabling institutional framework for sustainable private investment in industries dependent on ocean ecosystem services, notably tourism. Three broad investment components are proposed: i)   Development of economic opportunities in tuna fisheries through improvements in governance and through investment in value addition (where explicit economic benefits are identified);ii)   Development of collective management systems to improve coastal and reef fisheries management; iii)   Development of regulatory frameworks and market systems to manage human impacts and promote investment in wider ecosystem services.

With the approval of the overall program and first APL, the Executive Board of Directors would delegate the authority for approval of subsequent phases of the APL to the Regional Vice President, to enhance efficiency.

The delivery of the ERs according to the delivery schedule agreed upon in the Emission Reduction Purchase Agreement (ERPA) is the results indicator that is being monitored by the World Bank over the ERPA duration.<br />\n<br />\n2. The project has the following specifictechnical objectives: (a) Agriculture Land Management including Agroforestry: to increase food production and household income by expanding legume-based agroforestry systems with demonstrated higher sustainable crop yields, and production of important firewood, materials and tradable carbon compared to thebaseline of traditional smallholder agriculture; (b) Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD): More specifically the Project will promote sustainable climate-smart agricultural practices in selected chiefdoms in the Eastern Province of the Republic of Zambia (GRZ). The adoption of sustainable agriculture practices will increase small-holder farmer crop yield, farmer income and welfare, reduce uncontrolled forest loss and degradation, which would be supported inthe short term by carbon revenues received from a significant increase in bio-carbon sequestration in agricultural areas and avoided emissions in forested areas. \n\n To protect and expand areas under natural forest and conserve biodiversity through the intensification of food production on existing farm plots by adoption of legume-based agroforestry with in-built firewood production and avoidance of fallows, which will replace the need for further forest clearing as part of slash and burn agriculture, firewood and charcoal production. The decisions on land delineation for specific management purposes rest with the chiefs in consultation with the communities. Currently the challenge is one where allocation of forest areas for agricultural purposes to communities is made by the chief, and as a result the forested areas within the chiefdom are shrinking over time. Several chiefdoms have recognized the problemand are willing to set aside forest areas within chiefdoms for conservation use known as community conservation areas (CCAs). The interventions in CCAs will include land use planning, and preparation forest management plans by communities for managing conservation areas through implementing practices that will ensure that the forest areas are sustained. Agreements between chiefdoms and COMACOinclude provisions for implementation. The agreement also requires the Chiefs to submit a benefit sharing plan that will ensure fair distribution or usage of revenue channeled through the sale of Emission Reductions generated from the Project.",

This Regional MSP will cover China,Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam and knowledge management support to the GEF/WB platform program on Scaling Up Partnership Investments for Sustainable Development of the Large Marine Ecosystems of East Asia and their Coasts.  The project will support the collection, review, packaging and dissemination of lessons learned and best practices demonstrated under the investment projects co-financed by IBRD/IDA and GEF in these four countries. The knowledge management support system is intended to contribute to strengthening political commitments of national and local governments, donors and private investors for upscaling and replication of successful projects, tools and procedures. The specific goals of the project are to establish a regionally and country-owned knowledge platform that i) facilitates the integration of investments in sustaining ecosystem services into national and regional economic and development policies, processes and plans; ii) strengthens linkages to the sustainable development agenda adopted by countries of the region (i.e., the Sustainable Development Strategy for the Seas of East Asia or SDS-SEA); and iii) enhances capacities and services at the central and local government levels for developing and implementing investment projects. In order to achieve this goal, the project will bring together policy makers, local chief executives, project managers, practitioners, adademia, investors and the business sector, and will work through a range of activities under three components: A regional ICM e-Library and knowledge sharing portal: A regionally and country-owned knowledge platform and portal to promote dialogue and improve the exchange of knowledge, information and methods within and between countries on Integrated Coastal Management (ICM) and investment in sustaining marine and coastal ecosystem services, and a connection to existing and emerging networks and initiatives across the region and globally.

The GEF project is fully integrated in the World Bank supported Uttarakhand Decentralized Watershed Development Project (UDWDP) that in turn draws on the positive experiences from the Integrated Watershed Development Hills-II project that was completed in 2005. The UDWDP is consistent with the World Bank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Country Assistance Strategy that has a priority to \"support better management of watersheds, while enhancing the livelihood opportunities of the poor\". The project focuses on protection of watersheds, along with community-level capacity building and promotion of livelihoods. The project is spread over an area of around 238,000 ha, ranging from 700 m to 2000 m altitude in 76 selected micro watersheds in the middle Himalayas. About 451 Gram Panchayats (GP) identified in 18 blocks of 11 districts will participate in this project. A total population of 254,000, living in the project area will benefit from these activities.\n Activities financed by additional financing will focus on 20 micro watersheds that have high erosion indices, which are left behind in terms of socio-economic and other criteria and are predominantly situated close to the agricultural frontier. With this targeted approach on the most vulnerable areas, the impact of the project will be positive both in socio-economic and environmental terms. The outcome of the additional financing project will be measured against the following performance indicators: (i) Sustainable Watershed Management mainstreamed into 20 local government plans including parts of watersheds for which two or more Gram Panchayats have shared governance responsibility; (ii) Implementation of alternative technologies and approaches for enhancing water availability for agriculture and other domestic use; (iii) reduction in community dependency of forest for fuel wood and entering markets with medicinal and aromatic plants; (iv) improved knowledge of the impact of climate change on mountain ecosystems translated into coping strategies; (v) new and innovative techniques and approaches for sustainable land an ecosystem management up-scaled within the Uttarakhand state.

The objective of the Strategic Program is to strengthen sustainable management of forest ecosystems of the Congo Basin as a contribution to the conservation of the globally relevant biodiversity and ecosystem services, maintaining a solid foundation for the region's sustainable development. One of the outcomes of the Strategic Program, as stated in the Program Framework Document approved by the GEF CEO council on November 2008, consists of boosting the capacity of COMIFAC to serve as a regional coordination mechanism for (i) improved advocacy for and harmonization of sustainable forest management across the region, (ii) realization of synergies between various targeted sub-sectoral or thematic initiatives contributing to the SFM agenda, and (iii) strengthened knowledge exchange and learning processes between countries. This project falls under the larger framework of the Strategic Program for Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) in the Congo Basin. The Strategic Program for SFM presents a programmatic approach aiming to deliver multiple global environmental benefits across the Congo River ecosystem and adding value to a proposed portfolio of projects envisioned under the Strategic Program. Each of the projects that together form the portfolio of the Strategic Program for SFM in the Congo Basin presents a highly specialized and targeted entry point to sustainable forest management. By means of being under the Strategic Program, value can be added to each of the projects through realization of synergies and multiplier effects. However, coordination is critical if one wants to achieve this goal and COMIFAC SE, which is the regional entities expected to ensure this coordination, has some limitations and can not always play this coordination role. This is why the need for such an Medium-Size Project has been identified, with the aim of facilitating the information and experience sharing and fostering synergies amongst the different initiatives. This MSP project is articulated aournd four components: Comp. 1: Supporting Coordination & Communication on SFM operations in the Congo Basin under the GEF Program for the Congo Basin Comp. 2: Operationalizing COMIFAC Executive Secretariat Comp. 3: Creating knowledge on Sustainable Forest Management & Providing guidance to COMIFAC members Comp. 4: Project Management Component 1: Supporting Coordination & Communication on SFM operations in the Congo Basin The GEF Strategic Program only accounts for a dozen operations, executed by four different agencies (World Bank, UNDP, UNEP, FAO, AfDB). There are also numerous different initiatives at the regional and national level supported by the international community. The challenge to implement all these initiatives in a coordinated manner, to learn lessons from each of them and cross-fertilize is enormous. The COMIFAC SE has undoubtedly a key role to play in this coordination and is well positioned to foster knowledge sharing and dissemination amongst Congo Basin countries. The proposed component aims at supporting to COMIFAC SE in its role of coordination of the SFM operations in the Congo Basin. It will mainly rely on the following activities: (i)   Support to the communication activities: a key aspect is a smooth transfer of information and an efficient knowledge sharing amongst the different institutions in charge of SFM activities in the Congo Basin. The COMIFAC has already elaborated a communication strategy that is partially supported by the French Cooperation and the GTZ. However, some activities are still lacking resources to be properly implemented, such as the publication of the COMIFAC Brief notes, the participation to internat",

Research to date indicates that the Nam Et-Phou Louey (NEPL) National Protected Area (NPA) and landscape in northern Laos is one of the most promising locations for the recovery of tiger and prey populations in Indochina.  Although tiger and prey numbers are depressed, there is ample habitat, a sufficient source population and the political will to recover this globally important tiger conservation landscape over the next decade.  To do so will require reducing the direct killing of tigers for trade and the overharvest of tiger prey for trade and susbistence.  The landscape design for reducing these threats is to secure a 3,000 sq km hunting-free protected area core zone for maintaining a breeding population of tigers and their prey while working with communties around the core zone to enhance natural resource management and governance.  This project is currently applying two management interventions - law enforcement and conservation outreach - in one half of the NPA to address these issues.  With support from the GEF, we will be able to continue and to expand these activities to include the entire protected area and also to introduce two new components - village wildlife management and wildlife-based ecotourism.  The expected benefits from the expanded conservation outreach component is that all communities around the NPA will be empowered to participate in, support and benefit from the improved land use zoning, protected area management and governance.  The anticipated benefits from the village wildlife management component will be the sustainable offtake of forest products by communities in the NPA management zone, which will contribute to diet diversity and food security, as well as develop a model for reducing human-wildlife confict. The expected benefits of the ecotourism component are sustainable financing for the protected area as well as income and economic incentives for local communities to support tiger conservation in the landscape.  With support from our matching funds, this project will continue to strengthen the capacity of the NPA to enforce conservation laws (patrolling for and prosecuting illegal hunters, controlling guns, rewarding informants, removing traps and illegal grazing areas) while monitoring trends in law enforcement and tiger and prey populations to measure the success of the interventions. We expect that this will result in conserving the Nam Et-Phou Louey ecosystem for the long term as a model for tiger landscape management in Asia.",

        "description": "As Asia's largest top predator, the tiger is the region's most important and charismatic umbrella species. As such the health of tiger populations is a useful indicator of the health, effectiveness and sustainability of the region's protected area networks. Moreover since tigers are wide-ranging species which require large landscapes  to maintain viable populations,  effective conservation measures are required both within, and beyond, protected area boundaries to maintain biological corridors and tiger habitats within the broader production landscape and to strengthen  policy and regulatory frameworks to  protect tigers from national and international trade. Improved protection of tigers and their habitats, and improved enforcement capacity along potential trade chains, will benefit other globally-important  species with which the tiger  shares  forests and grasslands within the range states. Tigers are Asian religious and cultural icons, the national animal in some countries and figure on the flags of others. However, within the last century, their numbers have plummeted from over 100,000 to below 4000 animals. Tigers are listed by IUCN as Endangered, because their total effective population size is estimated at below 2,500 mature breeding individuals, with a declining trend due to habitat and prey base loss and persecution, and no subpopulation containing more than 250 mature breeding individuals. The existing wild populations inhabit fragmented and isolated patches of land that constitute just 7 per cent of their historic range. Habitat loss and trophy hunting were once the primary threats to the tigers' survival. Conversion of habitats to agriculture and other intrusive uses led to sharp declines in tiger numbers through the 1970s and 80s. Habitat loss is still an issue, but poaching of tigers and their prey is now the most urgent and immediate threat to tigers. Tigers are killed for the flourishing illegal trade in tiger parts for traditional oriental medicine, clothing, and home decor. Legal international trade in tiger products has been banned since 1975 through inclusion of the species in Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) . However, the illegal international trade in wild tigers remains highly profitable, well-structured and has close links to other organized crime. Poaching of tiger prey is a further major threat. Even though legislation is in place to protect tigers throughout their natural range, wildlife agencies frequently lack resources, expertise, and sometimes political support for effective enforcement of laws. Much of the illegal demand for tiger parts and products originates from large urban areas in tiger range states whose own tiger populations have been reduced or extirpated. Poaching has become so intense that tigers have disappeared even from some protected areas where they were once thought to be secure. The consequences are particularly damaging in areas with a depleted prey base due to poaching or habitat degradation, where tiger numbers are already low and growth is slow because cubs are at high risk of starvation. Serious though the situation is, it has been shown that with good protection, tiger populations can recover quickly and are therefore a reliable indicator of conservation efforts and healthy ecosystems, as has been well illustrated for the Amur tiger in the Russian Far East This project will address the major threats to tiger conservation, and the large natural landscapes on which they depend, through three interlinked components. The project will provide a framework for collaborative efforts between the range states (and the national and international NGOs working within them) and complement national efforts targeted to individual sites. As part of the project the Bank will organize high-level Country Dialogue Workshops in each of the range states as well as offer to host a Year of the Tiger Summit in 2010 to build",

Burundi has a population of about 6.8 million in a small geographic area; the population density, 240 persons per square kilometer, is the highest in Africa. Burundi is one of the poorest countries in the world, with per capita GNP of only US$110 (2001). Between 1993 and 2000 the poverty level in rural areas, where 90 percent of Burundi?s people live, rose from 25 percent to 45 percent and the poverty level in urban areas rose from 33 percent to about 65 percent. Moreover, between 1992 and 2000, per capital income decreased 5 percent annually, mainly because many farms are located   in areas where access to agricultural inputs and markets is difficult, crops and cattle have been pillaged, market prices have fallen, employment in the urban private sector has fallen off, and inflation  has risen.\n Low agricultural production. Burundi has substantial agricultural potential, with adequate rainfall and good soils. Agriculture is the mainstay of the economy, employing more than 90 percent of the active population and accounting for 50 percent of GDP and over 80 percent of export earnings. Agricultural production is subsistence-oriented except for the cash crops (coffee, tea, rice, sugar, and cotton) that are oriented toward export markets. Traditionally, Burundi has been self-sufficient in food production, but during the civil crisis in the 1990s, production did not keep pace with population growth. During the crisis, looting and destruction of household goods and livestock deprived farmers of their most important possessions, at the same time that distribution and marketing channels for agricultural inputs and products collapsed. \n The  Government?s Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy identified  the followingissues  related to sustainable growth in the agricultural sector  (see Annex 1):\n - \tLow farm productivity,\n -\tInadequate agricultural research and extension services,\n -\tExcessive focus on the coffee and cotton subsectors, \n - \tPoor access to agricultural inputs and rural finance, and \n - \tDegradation of natural resources. \n The economic collapse and the discontinuation of many public services in Burundi have caused widespread suffering and severely restricted agricultural development. In rural areas, health services have declined by 36 percent at the same time that HIV/AIDS has continued to spread.  In 2001 the overall infection rate reached 7.4 percent (20 percent in urban areas), maternal mortality rates have increased, and only 48 percent of the population has access to potable water. The Ministry of Agriculture has limited capacity to design, implement, and monitor rural development policies and projects. Data on the rural sector are nearly nonexistent; what information exists is poorly organized and difficult to access.  \n The Government?s strategy. The  Government in Burundi must deal with the following basic issues in agricultural and rural development: (a) how to raise production and productivity and how to diversify sources of income in rural areas; (b) how to improve access to such essential factors of production as extension, quality seed and new agricultural technologies, farm inputs, and rural finance; and (c) how to improve access to markets and ensure that there are enough institutions in the sector  to deliver efficient services and to preparing and monitor investment projects.\n According to the Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy and other documents, the Government seeks to promote broad-based agricultural and rural growth by (a) supporting and reintegrating displaced persons and other victims of conflict into agricultural production processes; (b) stimulating rural employment, through development of public works programs and small and medium-size enterprises and industries; (c) increasing access to markets, through rehabilitation and development of agricultural and rural infrastructure and removal of agricultural trade bar",

More specifically, this will be measured by an increase in the number of yard taps and public water points (or, stand posts).  To increase access for the poorest and reduce the cost of water throughout the towns or RGCs, a minimum number of public water points should be constructed and operated. \n To ensure that the pilot will result in least cost solutions, the project will involve competitive tendering for the private operators that will construct and operate the systems.

The miombo is of outstanding international importance for the conservation of flora and fuana, many of which are endemic to the region. In response to the highly acidic soils of the miombo woodlands, the traditional farming system is the slash and burn where vegetation is removed from between 2-3 ha by farmers and burnt in plots averaging 0.3-0.4 ha. The ashes increase the ph of the soils and are a source of additional nutrients. This system supports a period of cultivation of up to 5 years. However, rapid population growth is increase pressure on land and progressively shortening the period of fallow. Decline in soil fertility has led to food insecurity. The rapid degradation of the soil is also of global concern. The project is intended to promote a shift from slash and burn to more sustainable land management practices which have been successfully tried in other areas. These practices include the application of conservation farming (CF) at the farm level and integrated ecosystem management (IEM). Examples of CF are crop rotation, no- or minimum tillage, use of agricultural lime and the use of crop cover crops. IEM measures includes community fire control and agroforestry. The vehicle that will be used in the promotion of these practices is the succesfully tested Farmer Field Schools.",

        "description": "The PDO is to support the acquisition of land and the formation of sustainable farm enterprises by self-organized landless and land-poor peasant families. As a pilot program, the Land Access Pilot Project (PACTA) tests a public-private partnership strategy with interested private sector lending institutions for land purchase and the use of public sector funds, through the project, supporting complementary investments, and technical assistance to improve the productivity of the newly acquired properties. If successful, the Government would consider scaling up the pilot to a national fund mechanism for land purchase in several years.  The concentration of the best lands among a small percentage of landholders (less than 4% of farms have more than 50% of total land) in Honduras makes it extremely difficult for family scale producers to participate effectively in the land market. Private land is available to the smallest producers, since they do not have the needed collateral and cannot bid on the larger size productive plots that more often enter the market. PACTA is therefore designed to provide an economy of scale to small rural producers who wish to purchase land for productive activities. Such transfers would be likely to result in more intensive land uses. While individuals can also be beneficiaries, the majority of the participants are expected to be groups of producers who collectively identify land for sale, develop a business plan for that land, and assume collective responsibility for investment and repayment until the loan is paid off, and they can exercise their individual rights over their own parcels. Key performance indicators: (i) Volume of lending leveraged from private financial institutions for land purchase -,,Financial institutions develop appropriate methodology to deliver credit products for land purchase by target population; and devote at least US$2.5 million to this purpose. -,,At least seventy-five percent of families identifies as eligible by the Unidades Tecnicas Locales receive private financing for land purchase.  (ii) Quality of the loan portfolio -,,At least eighty-five percent of groups participating in the project are able to pay off land purchase loans and maintain viable enterprises (participant families negotiated land purchase, established legal structure, entered into credit contracts, and expanded new enterprises). (iii) Increase in income of participating families -,,At least 15% increase on family income through land productivity and output in acquired lands. (iv) Validation of a decentralized model for land access -,,Pilot evaluation leads to endorsement of expansion of program and PACTA is established as a national program operating in conformity with the tested implementation model. (v) Local social accountability and constituency building around the program -,,The functions attributed to the Consejo Directivo de PACTA have been absorbed by the Redes Regionales de Apoyo (the Regional Support Networks) to provide the constituency that would support the transformation of PACTA from a pilot project to a national program. The Regional Support Networks provide an articulation of operative local and national alliances, strengthen the project?s policies and procedures, enrich its norms and operational manual, and provide a social accountability for the use of funds.",

An important objective of the improved management plans will be to reduce human pressure in order to remove threats of pollution, intensive human use and loss of naturalness. This would be achieved by limiting the numbers of permanent staff, researchers and their equipment to a minimum on each island and by improving the management of the flow of visitors. Another objective will be to promote more research, education and awareness activities as well as maximise the use of scarce human resources to benefit all three islands through the exchange of staff and collaboration on joint programs. The establishment of new facilities such as the Praslin Centre would thus improves delivery to a broader array of stakeholders, whilst improving the sustainable use of the islands.

        "description": "The Ecological Corridors Project aims to contribute to the effective conservation of Brazil's  biodiversity by testing an innovative approach in two of Brazil's most important biomes. The project's overall objective is to demonstrate the viability of ecological corridors in conserving biodiversity in the Brazilian Amazon and Atlantic rainforests. The project is divided in two phases: The first phase will take approximately 18 months and will focus largely upon establishing the institutional infrastructure for the Central Amazon (CAC) and Atlantic Forest(CAFC) corridors, and developing management plans based upon multi-disciplinary studies of biodiversity and related economic, social and political characteristics relevant to successful corridor management. It will also launch the first conservation initiatives and pilot techniques derived from the corridor management plans. By the end of the 18 month-phase it is expected that significant progress will have been made in establishing prototype corridor management institutions and plans that would orient implementation efforts in the second phase. During the second phase, with an expected duration of 42 months, the project will focus on the consolidation of corridors monitoring and vigilance systems, implementation of corridors management plans and implementation of sub-projects in interstitial areas.",
