        "description": "Key components of the WFSO database cover severe food insecurity prevalence, estimates for countries lacking official data, population sizes of the severely food insecure, and required safety net financing. Data is presented in a user-friendly format.<br><br>WFSO data primarily relies on hunger and malnutrition data from the State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World (SOFI) report, led by the Food and agriculture Organization (FAO) in collaboration with multiple UN agencies. WFSO complements SOFI data by providing estimates for unreported countries. Historical estimates are produced with a World Bank machine learning model leveraging World Development Indicators (WDI) for global coverage. <br><br>Financing needs for safety nets are calculated similarly to past approaches by the International Development Association (IDA) to assess food insecurity response needs. Preliminary estimates and projections rely on the same model and incorporate IMF's World Economic Outlook (WEO) growth and inflation forecasts. WEO data reflects the IMF's expert analysis from various sources, including government agencies, central banks, and international organizations. <br><br>Minor gaps in WDI data inflation data are replaced with unofficial WEO estimates. Minor inflation data gaps not covered by both, are replaced with unofficial inflation estimates from the World Bank's Real-Time Food Prices (RTFP) data.<br><br>The WFSO is updated three times a year, coinciding with IMF's WEO and SOFI releases. It provides food security projections that align with economic forecasts, aiding policymakers in integrating food security into economic planning.<br><br>The WFSO database serves various purposes, aiding World Bank economists and researchers in economic analysis, policy recommendations, and the assessment of global financing needs to address food insecurity.<br><br>Additionally, the WFSO enhances transparency in global food security data by tracking regional and global figures and breaking them down by individual countries. Historical estimates support research and long-term trend assessments, especially in the context of relating outlooks to past food security crises.",

Specifically, the 2022 TDHS-MIS collected information on marriage and sexual activity, fertility and fertility preferences, family planning, infant and child mortality, maternal health care, disability among the household population, child health, nutrition of children and women, malaria prevalence, knowledge, and communication, women\u2019s empowerment, women\u2019s experience of domestic violence, adult maternal mortality via sisterhood method, awareness and behaviour regarding HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), female genital cutting, and early childhood development. Other information collected on health-related issues included smoking, blood pressure, anaemia, malaria, and iodine testing, height and weight, and micronutrients.<br><br>The information collected through the 2022 TDHS-MIS is intended to assist policymakers and programme managers in evaluating and designing programmes and strategies for improving the health of Tanzania\u2019s population. The 2022 TDHS-MIS also provides indicators to monitor and evaluate international, regional, and national programmes, such as the Global Agenda 2030 on Sustainable Development Goals (2030 SDGs), Tanzania Development Vision 2025, the Third National Five-Year Development Plan (FYDP III 2021/22\u20132025/26), East Africa Community Vision 2050 (EAC 2050), and Africa Development Agenda 2063 (ADA 2063).",

        "description": "The main objective of this activity is to shed light on the transformative potential of smallholder irrigation in Mozambique. Irrigation is critical in ensuring sustainable livelihoods for farmers in the face of increasing climate uncertainty. Irrigation access allows farmers to cultivate crops outside of the main rainy season, potentially doubling farm incomes by allowing for the cultivation of two crop cycles instead of one. However, it is grossly underutilized in Sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in Mozambique where only 8 percent of all farmers have access to irrigation. Despite the transformative potential of irrigation, there are gaps in our understanding of how-to best plan and manage irrigation infrastructure programs. First, because irrigation infrastructure is never placed at random, the true impact of these investments on farmers\u2019 welfare is not well known. Second, irrigation equipment is often not well managed and degrades easily over time from lack of maintenance. This impact evaluation proposes a novel strategy for simultaneously measuring a rigorous estimate of the returns to irrigation investments, as well as providing insight on how to choose participants of an irrigation infrastructure program such that the impact and sustainability of the irrigation infrastructure is maximized.",

Interviews were conducted over the phone in August and September 2022, using a questionnaire consisting of four sections mainly focusing on labor market experiences and food insecurity. Although the survey was implemented over the phone, it is expected to have adequate coverage of the target population, as mobile phone ownership was widespread in Yemen prior to the start of the conflict. According to the Household Budget survey of 2014, 81 percent of households owned a mobile phone. While there is no recent national level data on mobile phone ownership, representative data of areas under IRG control show that mobile phone ownership increased from 84 percent in 2014 to 92 percent in 2021 (Yemen Human Development Survey 2021). Additionally, a study comparing the number of mobile phones households owned in the World Food Programme (WFP) mobile Vulnerability Analysis and Mapping (mVAM) phone survey finds a similar number to that of the last nationally representative survey, the 2014 Household Budget Survey (HBS), except for some governorates where the number of mobile phones declined due to significant population migration.",

In response to some of these difficulties, theWorld Bank and the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security developed the Mozambique Sustainable Irrigation Project (PROIRRI) between 2011 and 2018, with the primary development objective to raise farm productivity in new or improved irrigation schemes and increase agricultural production marketed in the provinces of Sofala, Manica and Zamb\u00e9zia.",

This second wave of the refugee sample aims to provide a snapshot of the situation for refugees in Djibouti as the economic recovery from the pandemic began. The sample consists of 436 respondents, 286 of whom are based in refugee villages, and 150 refugees living in urban areas. Various channels of impact are explored such as job loss, availability and price changes of basic food items, ability to access healthcare and education, food insecurity. The survey also includes a section on gender issues, including time-use and decision making, as well as a section on attitudes towards COVID-19 Vaccine. Within households, a respondent was chosen at random between the household heads and spouses, allowing comparison between female and male respondents in the sample.
