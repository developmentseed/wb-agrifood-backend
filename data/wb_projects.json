Attention will be given to reflecting lessons learned from other similar projects, replicating successful interventio ns, and ensuring continued technical support during project implementation \u2013 so this portfolio becomes a series of case studies for the region.#  #  The Regional Partnership for African Fisheries Policy Reform is also a follow-up phase medium sized project to the GEF/World Bank Strategic Partnership project, which was implemented by the AU between 2009 and 2011, and the last project planned un der the Program Framework Document \u201cStrategic Partnership for Sustainable Fisheries Management in the Large Marine Ecosystems in Afr ica\u201d (P125797). TheProject will be financed through a US$2 million Bank-Executed GEF Trust Fund between 2015 and 2018 for a duration  of 3 years. It will act as a regional knowledge and monitoring hub for a SSA GEF/World Bank portfolio of current and pipelinefisher ies reform projects (\u201cparticipating projects\u201d) and related partner-supported activities, with the objective of improving the accessi bility to best practices and new knowledge on fisheries management of selected SSA countries. Within this context, it is expected th at the Project will assist African coastal countries to make concrete progress towards achieving the fisheries and poverty reduction  targets set by the 2002 WSSD, the follow-up 2012 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20), and the 2014 Policy  Framework and Reform Strategy for Fisheries and Aquaculture in Africa.

This abundant oceanscape, and the ecosystem services it provides, is a shared natural capital asset for the entire region.  It provides valuable services such as the provision of fish for food products, and key biodiversity and habitats that support tourism, as well as carbon storage. The project's objective will be achieved by financing the countries to collaborate to improve the governance of the use of this shared natural capital asset, establishing an enabling institutional framework for sustainable private investment in industries dependent on ocean ecosystem services, notably tourism. Three broad investment components are proposed: i)   Development of economic opportunities in tuna fisheries through improvements in governance and through investment in value addition (where explicit economic benefits are identified);ii)   Development of collective management systems to improve coastal and reef fisheries management; iii)   Development of regulatory frameworks and market systems to manage human impacts and promote investment in wider ecosystem services. A horizontal Adaptable Program Loan (APL) will be pursued, whereby the overall investment program is prepared and agreed, with the first group of several countries ready to launch as APL 1, and then additional countries join when ready in subsequent phases of the APL, until all eligible countries have joined.  With the approval of the overall program and first APL, the Executive Board of Directors would delegate the authority for approval of subsequent phases of the APL to the Regional Vice President, to enhance efficiency. In order to implement the shared objective and approach of the proposed program, each phase of the APL would finance activities that would be implemented at the regional level (through an established regional organization), as well as activities that would be implemented nationally in each participating country.   More specifically: Component 1 Economic Development of Pacific Island tuna fisheries: The majority of financing and implementation of this component would be at the regional level via GEF and IDA funds, and would include all of the eligible countries participating (via implementation by a regional organization). Component 2 Coastal Fisheries Management: Implementation of this component would be undertaken at the national level with regional coordination (and learning exchange), largely via parallel financing from partners. Component 3 Environmental Regulation and Supporting Markets: Implementation of this component 3 would be developed largely at the regional level, via parallel financing from partners. While component 1 would be implemented almost entirely at the regional level,  all three components have high spillover effects given the shared nature of the countries' transboundary living ocean resources.  This investment framework would provide a common platform for support by a wide range of partners participating in the Global Partnership for Oceans (via parallel financing), linked to equity investments where feasible by the IFC.",

        "Project Development Objective ": "The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to &ldquo;improve access to essential productive assets, services, and markets for pastoralists and agro-pastoralists in selected trans-border areas and along transhumance axes across six Sahel countries, and strengthen country capacities to respond promptly and effectively to pastoral crises or emergencies.&rdquo; In this way, the proposed project will support improved productivity, sustainability, and resilience of pastoral livelihoods, as prioritized in the Nouakchott Declaration on Pastoralism.<br />\n<br />\nThe PDO will be achieved through a combination of strategic investments, capacity building, and policy dialogue. The pastoral population includes all people (active and inactive persons of all ages) who are members of a livestock-keeping household that: (i) obtains at least 90 percent of its animal feed requirement from grazing natural vegetation and (ii) derives at least 50 percent of its income from livestock. The agro-pastoral population includes all people (active and inactive persons of all ages) who are members of a livestock-keeping household that: (i) obtains 10 percent or more of its animal feed requirement from crop residues and (ii) derives at least 50 percent of its income from cropping activities.<br />\n<br />\nThe main beneficiaries of PRAPS will be pastoralists and agro-pastoralists in Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, and Senegal; specific trans-boundary geographic areas and transhumance axes are prioritized in each of these six countries. The proposed project is expected to benefit 2,070,000 people directly (200,000 in Burkina Faso, 400,000 in Chad, 440,000 in Mali, 400,000 in Mauritania, 400,000 in Niger, and 230,000 in Senegal) whose livelihoods rely mainly on pastoral activities, including but not limited to livestock keeping or marketing. Target groups include women and youth, who will benefit from the project&rsquo;s overall activities and from activities specifically addressing their needs whenever possible. Secondary beneficiaries include service providers (both public and private), as well as national and regional institutions. CILSS will be a major institutional beneficiary of this project, alongside CRSA (Centre R&eacute;gional de Sant&eacute; Animale, the ECOWAS Regional Animal Health Center, based in Bamako) and other regional coordinating partners at the technical level. Under the harmonized approach of the Alliance Globale pour la R&eacute;silience (Global Alliance for Resilience, AGIR) partnership, the goals of PRAPS and other development partners are expected to align to strengthen coordination andmonitoring capacities within the Sahel.",

This pillar also includes a reform that will strengthen hydro-meteorological services to contribute to disaster risk reduction and management, and to improve early warning systems. The reforms selected for support address key poverty issues &ndash; including the resilience of smallholder farmers to short-term weather risks and longer-term climate change, and access to effective early warning systems, as well as sustainability issues - including climate resilience of infrastructure, energy efficiency and renewable energy access.The operation&nbsp;was the second, single tranche operation ina series of three climate change Development Policy Operations (DPOs).

The development objective of the COMACO Landscape Project is to reduce emissions of Greenhouse Gases (GHG) through the sustainable management within 270,698 ha of land traditionally devoted to community led agricultural and non-agricultural activities. The delivery of the ERs according to the delivery schedule agreed upon in the Emission Reduction Purchase Agreement (ERPA) is the results indicator that is being monitored by the World Bank over the ERPA duration.<br />\n<br />\n2. The project has the following specifictechnical objectives: (a) Agriculture Land Management including Agroforestry: to increase food production and household income by expanding legume-based agroforestry systems with demonstrated higher sustainable crop yields, and production of important firewood, materials and tradable carbon compared to thebaseline of traditional smallholder agriculture; (b) Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD): More specifically the Project will promote sustainable climate-smart agricultural practices in selected chiefdoms in the Eastern Province of the Republic of Zambia (GRZ). The adoption of sustainable agriculture practices will increase small-holder farmer crop yield, farmer income and welfare, reduce uncontrolled forest loss and degradation, which would be supported inthe short term by carbon revenues received from a significant increase in bio-carbon sequestration in agricultural areas and avoided emissions in forested areas. \n\n To protect and expand areas under natural forest and conserve biodiversity through the intensification of food production on existing farm plots by adoption of legume-based agroforestry with in-built firewood production and avoidance of fallows, which will replace the need for further forest clearing as part of slash and burn agriculture, firewood and charcoal production. The decisions on land delineation for specific management purposes rest with the chiefs in consultation with the communities. Currently the challenge is one where allocation of forest areas for agricultural purposes to communities is made by the chief, and as a result the forested areas within the chiefdom are shrinking over time. Several chiefdoms have recognized the problemand are willing to set aside forest areas within chiefdoms for conservation use known as community conservation areas (CCAs). The interventions in CCAs will include land use planning, and preparation forest management plans by communities for managing conservation areas through implementing practices that will ensure that the forest areas are sustained. Agreements between chiefdoms and COMACOinclude provisions for implementation. The agreement also requires the Chiefs to submit a benefit sharing plan that will ensure fair distribution or usage of revenue channeled through the sale of Emission Reductions generated from the Project.",

By increasing their incomes, the Project will help reduce rural poverty, increase food security and contribute to the achievement of a key Millennium Development Goal (MDG). \n  The Third National Fadama Development Project (Fadama III Project (Fadama III) aims at sustainably increasing the incomes of Fadama resource users by directly delivering resources to the beneficiary rural communities, efficiently and effectively, and empowering them to collectively decide on how resources are allocated and managed for their livelihood activities and to participate in the design and execution of their sub-projects. A team of Facilitators will be deployed in each community to provide training and technical assistance support to ensure that Fadama resource users, including women and other vulnerable groups, have a voice in the decision-making process and benefit equally from project inputs.  These objectives will be achieved through the financing and implementation of four main components designed to transfer financial and technical resources to the beneficiary groups -- the FCAs in: (i) institutional and social capital development; (ii) physical infrastructure for productive use; (iii) income-generation and livelihood improvements; and (iv) transfer and adoption of technological know-how; as well as (v) implementation coordination. The new PDO will be: to increase the incomes for users of rural lands and water resources in a sustainable manner, and to contribute  to restoration of the livelihoods of conflict affected households in the selected area in the North East of the Recipient's territo ry",

The project will facilitate achievement of GEF International Waters (IW) Objective 3, Outcome 3.3 (IW Portfolio capacity and performance enhanced from active learning, knowledge management and experience sharing.  This Regional MSP will cover China,Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam and knowledge management support to the GEF/WB platform program on Scaling Up Partnership Investments for Sustainable Development of the Large Marine Ecosystems of East Asia and their Coasts.  The project will support the collection, review, packaging and dissemination of lessons learned and best practices demonstrated under the investment projects co-financed by IBRD/IDA and GEF in these four countries. The knowledge management support system is intended to contribute to strengthening political commitments of national and local governments, donors and private investors for upscaling and replication of successful projects, tools and procedures. The specific goals of the project are to establish a regionally and country-owned knowledge platform that i) facilitates the integration of investments in sustaining ecosystem services into national and regional economic and development policies, processes and plans; ii) strengthens linkages to the sustainable development agenda adopted by countries of the region (i.e., the Sustainable Development Strategy for the Seas of East Asia or SDS-SEA); and iii) enhances capacities and services at the central and local government levels for developing and implementing investment projects. In order to achieve this goal, the project will bring together policy makers, local chief executives, project managers, practitioners, adademia, investors and the business sector, and will work through a range of activities under three components: A regional ICM e-Library and knowledge sharing portal: A regionally and country-owned knowledge platform and portal to promote dialogue and improve the exchange of knowledge, information and methods within and between countries on Integrated Coastal Management (ICM) and investment in sustaining marine and coastal ecosystem services, and a connection to existing and emerging networks and initiatives across the region and globally.  This knowledge sharing portal would connect to the WB Knowledge Portal to be established under the Global Partnership for the Oceans, which would provide global data on a series of ocean health indicators, including area of coastline/country under ICM. Innovative tools and best practices: a system for identifying, packaging and transferring new and innovative approaches and best practices to policymakers andpractitioners and for facilitating the mainstreaming of time bound priority targets andprojects under the brown and blue agenda into national and local government medium-term development and investment plans. Communities of practice and support services:  a support mechanism for national and local governments, providing access to and use of skills and experiences in the region and globally, as well as new and innovative tools and prctices, for the development of investment projects.",

This is a necessary first-step in reduction in the incidence of infectious diseases from animals to humans which will also lead to increase livestock productivity and strengthen the livelihoods base for food insecure communities. This objective would be achieved through two types of interventions: planning and preparedness; and prevention.   If successful, the proposed project would contribute to reduce the burden of disease in animals, the consequent economic losses, the risk of human infection, and the loss of productivity attributable to animal and human infections in Nepal. In addition, this project will specifically link up with the GAFSP-financed project that is being prepared in parallel, to supportthe realization of these outcomes in the mid- and far west regions of Nepal . The project would also leverage with and contribute to enhancing the Climate Resilience Agriculture Management Information System, which is prepared by the PPCR.",

The GEF project is fully integrated in the World Bank supported Uttarakhand Decentralized Watershed Development Project (UDWDP) that in turn draws on the positive experiences from the Integrated Watershed Development Hills-II project that was completed in 2005. The UDWDP is consistent with the World Bank\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Country Assistance Strategy that has a priority to \"support better management of watersheds, while enhancing the livelihood opportunities of the poor\". The project focuses on protection of watersheds, along with community-level capacity building and promotion of livelihoods. The project is spread over an area of around 238,000 ha, ranging from 700 m to 2000 m altitude in 76 selected micro watersheds in the middle Himalayas. About 451 Gram Panchayats (GP) identified in 18 blocks of 11 districts will participate in this project. A total population of 254,000, living in the project area will benefit from these activities.\n Activities financed by additional financing will focus on 20 micro watersheds that have high erosion indices, which are left behind in terms of socio-economic and other criteria and are predominantly situated close to the agricultural frontier. With this targeted approach on the most vulnerable areas, the impact of the project will be positive both in socio-economic and environmental terms. The outcome of the additional financing project will be measured against the following performance indicators: (i) Sustainable Watershed Management mainstreamed into 20 local government plans including parts of watersheds for which two or more Gram Panchayats have shared governance responsibility; (ii) Implementation of alternative technologies and approaches for enhancing water availability for agriculture and other domestic use; (iii) reduction in community dependency of forest for fuel wood and entering markets with medicinal and aromatic plants; (iv) improved knowledge of the impact of climate change on mountain ecosystems translated into coping strategies; (v) new and innovative techniques and approaches for sustainable land an ecosystem management up-scaled within the Uttarakhand state. Performance will be monitored periodically through well defined indicators by external specialists.",

        "Project Development Objective ": "The objective of the project is to strengthen COMIFAC's capacity for regional coordination of Sustainable Forest Management across the Congo Basin and to align regional program implementation to the Convergence Plan in the context of the GEF Program for the sustainable management of the forests of the Congo Basin. The objective of the Strategic Program is to strengthen sustainable management of forest ecosystems of the Congo Basin as a contribution to the conservation of the globally relevant biodiversity and ecosystem services, maintaining a solid foundation for the region's sustainable development. One of the outcomes of the Strategic Program, as stated in the Program Framework Document approved by the GEF CEO council on November 2008, consists of boosting the capacity of COMIFAC to serve as a regional coordination mechanism for (i) improved advocacy for and harmonization of sustainable forest management across the region, (ii) realization of synergies between various targeted sub-sectoral or thematic initiatives contributing to the SFM agenda, and (iii) strengthened knowledge exchange and learning processes between countries. This project falls under the larger framework of the Strategic Program for Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) in the Congo Basin. The Strategic Program for SFM presents a programmatic approach aiming to deliver multiple global environmental benefits across the Congo River ecosystem and adding value to a proposed portfolio of projects envisioned under the Strategic Program. Each of the projects that together form the portfolio of the Strategic Program for SFM in the Congo Basin presents a highly specialized and targeted entry point to sustainable forest management. By means of being under the Strategic Program, value can be added to each of the projects through realization of synergies and multiplier effects. However, coordination is critical if one wants to achieve this goal and COMIFAC SE, which is the regional entities expected to ensure this coordination, has some limitations and can not always play this coordination role. This is why the need for such an Medium-Size Project has been identified, with the aim of facilitating the information and experience sharing and fostering synergies amongst the different initiatives. This MSP project is articulated aournd four components: Comp. 1: Supporting Coordination & Communication on SFM operations in the Congo Basin under the GEF Program for the Congo Basin Comp. 2: Operationalizing COMIFAC Executive Secretariat Comp. 3: Creating knowledge on Sustainable Forest Management & Providing guidance to COMIFAC members Comp. 4: Project Management Component 1: Supporting Coordination & Communication on SFM operations in the Congo Basin The GEF Strategic Program only accounts for a dozen operations, executed by four different agencies (World Bank, UNDP, UNEP, FAO, AfDB). There are also numerous different initiatives at the regional and national level supported by the international community. The challenge to implement all these initiatives in a coordinated manner, to learn lessons from each of them and cross-fertilize is enormous. The COMIFAC SE has undoubtedly a key role to play in this coordination and is well positioned to foster knowledge sharing and dissemination amongst Congo Basin countries. The proposed component aims at supporting to COMIFAC SE in its role of coordination of the SFM operations in the Congo Basin. It will mainly rely on the following activities: (i)   Support to the communication activities: a key aspect is a smooth transfer of information and an efficient knowledge sharing amongst the different institutions in charge of SFM activities in the Congo Basin. The COMIFAC has already elaborated a communication strategy that is partially supported by the French Cooperation and the GTZ. However, some activities are still lacking resources to be properly implemented, such as the publication of the COMIFAC Brief notes, the participation to internat",

        "Project Name": "LA-Nam Et-Phou Louey Tiger Landscape Conservation Project",
        "Project Development Objective ": "The issue that this project addresses is the decline of tigers across their range, but specifically in Indochina.  Research to date indicates that the Nam Et-Phou Louey (NEPL) National Protected Area (NPA) and landscape in northern Laos is one of the most promising locations for the recovery of tiger and prey populations in Indochina.  Although tiger and prey numbers are depressed, there is ample habitat, a sufficient source population and the political will to recover this globally important tiger conservation landscape over the next decade.  To do so will require reducing the direct killing of tigers for trade and the overharvest of tiger prey for trade and susbistence.  The landscape design for reducing these threats is to secure a 3,000 sq km hunting-free protected area core zone for maintaining a breeding population of tigers and their prey while working with communties around the core zone to enhance natural resource management and governance.  This project is currently applying two management interventions - law enforcement and conservation outreach - in one half of the NPA to address these issues.  With support from the GEF, we will be able to continue and to expand these activities to include the entire protected area and also to introduce two new components - village wildlife management and wildlife-based ecotourism.  The expected benefits from the expanded conservation outreach component is that all communities around the NPA will be empowered to participate in, support and benefit from the improved land use zoning, protected area management and governance.  The anticipated benefits from the village wildlife management component will be the sustainable offtake of forest products by communities in the NPA management zone, which will contribute to diet diversity and food security, as well as develop a model for reducing human-wildlife confict. The expected benefits of the ecotourism component are sustainable financing for the protected area as well as income and economic incentives for local communities to support tiger conservation in the landscape.  With support from our matching funds, this project will continue to strengthen the capacity of the NPA to enforce conservation laws (patrolling for and prosecuting illegal hunters, controlling guns, rewarding informants, removing traps and illegal grazing areas) while monitoring trends in law enforcement and tiger and prey populations to measure the success of the interventions. We expect that this will result in conserving the Nam Et-Phou Louey ecosystem for the long term as a model for tiger landscape management in Asia.",

        "Country": "Asia",
        "Project Name": "Tiger Futures: Mainstreaming Conservation in Large Landscapes",
        "Project Development Objective ": "As Asia's largest top predator, the tiger is the region's most important and charismatic umbrella species. As such the health of tiger populations is a useful indicator of the health, effectiveness and sustainability of the region's protected area networks. Moreover since tigers are wide-ranging species which require large landscapes  to maintain viable populations,  effective conservation measures are required both within, and beyond, protected area boundaries to maintain biological corridors and tiger habitats within the broader production landscape and to strengthen  policy and regulatory frameworks to  protect tigers from national and international trade. Improved protection of tigers and their habitats, and improved enforcement capacity along potential trade chains, will benefit other globally-important  species with which the tiger  shares  forests and grasslands within the range states. Tigers are Asian religious and cultural icons, the national animal in some countries and figure on the flags of others. However, within the last century, their numbers have plummeted from over 100,000 to below 4000 animals. Tigers are listed by IUCN as Endangered, because their total effective population size is estimated at below 2,500 mature breeding individuals, with a declining trend due to habitat and prey base loss and persecution, and no subpopulation containing more than 250 mature breeding individuals. The existing wild populations inhabit fragmented and isolated patches of land that constitute just 7 per cent of their historic range. Habitat loss and trophy hunting were once the primary threats to the tigers' survival. Conversion of habitats to agriculture and other intrusive uses led to sharp declines in tiger numbers through the 1970s and 80s. Habitat loss is still an issue, but poaching of tigers and their prey is now the most urgent and immediate threat to tigers. Tigers are killed for the flourishing illegal trade in tiger parts for traditional oriental medicine, clothing, and home decor. Legal international trade in tiger products has been banned since 1975 through inclusion of the species in Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) . However, the illegal international trade in wild tigers remains highly profitable, well-structured and has close links to other organized crime. Poaching of tiger prey is a further major threat. Even though legislation is in place to protect tigers throughout their natural range, wildlife agencies frequently lack resources, expertise, and sometimes political support for effective enforcement of laws. Much of the illegal demand for tiger parts and products originates from large urban areas in tiger range states whose own tiger populations have been reduced or extirpated. Poaching has become so intense that tigers have disappeared even from some protected areas where they were once thought to be secure. The consequences are particularly damaging in areas with a depleted prey base due to poaching or habitat degradation, where tiger numbers are already low and growth is slow because cubs are at high risk of starvation. Serious though the situation is, it has been shown that with good protection, tiger populations can recover quickly and are therefore a reliable indicator of conservation efforts and healthy ecosystems, as has been well illustrated for the Amur tiger in the Russian Far East This project will address the major threats to tiger conservation, and the large natural landscapes on which they depend, through three interlinked components. The project will provide a framework for collaborative efforts between the range states (and the national and international NGOs working within them) and complement national efforts targeted to individual sites. As part of the project the Bank will organize high-level Country Dialogue Workshops in each of the range states as well as offer to host a Year of the Tiger Summit in 2010 to build",

PRSC 7 was presented to the Board in June 2008 for the amount of US$150 million.  PRSC 8 was approved in 2009 for US$ 350 million under the Fast Track Facility.

        "Project Development Objective ": "A.\tSTRATEGIC CONTEXT AND RATIONALE\n  1.\tCountry and sector issues \n Poverty in Burundi. Burundi has a population of about 6.8 million in a small geographic area; the population density, 240 persons per square kilometer, is the highest in Africa. Burundi is one of the poorest countries in the world, with per capita GNP of only US$110 (2001). Between 1993 and 2000 the poverty level in rural areas, where 90 percent of Burundi?s people live, rose from 25 percent to 45 percent and the poverty level in urban areas rose from 33 percent to about 65 percent. Moreover, between 1992 and 2000, per capital income decreased 5 percent annually, mainly because many farms are located   in areas where access to agricultural inputs and markets is difficult, crops and cattle have been pillaged, market prices have fallen, employment in the urban private sector has fallen off, and inflation  has risen.\n Low agricultural production. Burundi has substantial agricultural potential, with adequate rainfall and good soils. Agriculture is the mainstay of the economy, employing more than 90 percent of the active population and accounting for 50 percent of GDP and over 80 percent of export earnings. Agricultural production is subsistence-oriented except for the cash crops (coffee, tea, rice, sugar, and cotton) that are oriented toward export markets. Traditionally, Burundi has been self-sufficient in food production, but during the civil crisis in the 1990s, production did not keep pace with population growth. During the crisis, looting and destruction of household goods and livestock deprived farmers of their most important possessions, at the same time that distribution and marketing channels for agricultural inputs and products collapsed. \n The  Government?s Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy identified  the followingissues  related to sustainable growth in the agricultural sector  (see Annex 1):\n - \tLow farm productivity,\n -\tInadequate agricultural research and extension services,\n -\tExcessive focus on the coffee and cotton subsectors, \n - \tPoor access to agricultural inputs and rural finance, and \n - \tDegradation of natural resources. \n The economic collapse and the discontinuation of many public services in Burundi have caused widespread suffering and severely restricted agricultural development. In rural areas, health services have declined by 36 percent at the same time that HIV/AIDS has continued to spread.  In 2001 the overall infection rate reached 7.4 percent (20 percent in urban areas), maternal mortality rates have increased, and only 48 percent of the population has access to potable water. The Ministry of Agriculture has limited capacity to design, implement, and monitor rural development policies and projects. Data on the rural sector are nearly nonexistent; what information exists is poorly organized and difficult to access.  \n The Government?s strategy. The  Government in Burundi must deal with the following basic issues in agricultural and rural development: (a) how to raise production and productivity and how to diversify sources of income in rural areas; (b) how to improve access to such essential factors of production as extension, quality seed and new agricultural technologies, farm inputs, and rural finance; and (c) how to improve access to markets and ensure that there are enough institutions in the sector  to deliver efficient services and to preparing and monitor investment projects.\n According to the Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy and other documents, the Government seeks to promote broad-based agricultural and rural growth by (a) supporting and reintegrating displaced persons and other victims of conflict into agricultural production processes; (b) stimulating rural employment, through development of public works programs and small and medium-size enterprises and industries; (c) increasing access to markets, through rehabilitation and development of agricultural and rural infrastructure and removal of agricultural trade bar",

In 2008 the GoM announced that it will extend the PARPA II by one year to include 2010, thereby strengthening sustainability and continuity with the next strategic document.  PARPA II is mainly focused on shared growth and on the need for decentralization. Within this context, PRSC-5 is expected to help the GoM in: (a) the consolidation and deepening of the institutional reforms in the area of macroeconomic management; (b) reforms in governance by supporting decentralization to enhance public investments and service delivery at the provincial and district level, and by supporting public sector reform; and (c) economic development by removing constraints to growth, such as infrastructure, and promoting agricultural growth.

Achieving this objective should result in: \n  \n #\tless time spent collecting water at distant water points, and therefore increasing the possibility that resources are spent on other productive activities # including attending school (many of the water carriers are young girls); \n #\ta reduction of disease and death related to water borne illness; \n #\tlocalized and cost effective solutions for system design, including more co-ordination between system design, maintenance and operation; \n #\timproved financial viability of the existing water supply systems, including mobilizing alternative sources of finance for the sector; and, \n #\ta more transparent use of funds in the water sector. \n The main development objective of increased access will be measured by the number of increased working connections of a specified quality in the respective small towns and RGCs.  More specifically, this will be measured by an increase in the number of yard taps and public water points (or, stand posts).  To increase access for the poorest and reduce the cost of water throughout the towns or RGCs, a minimum number of public water points should be constructed and operated. \n To ensure that the pilot will result in least cost solutions, the project will involve competitive tendering for the private operators that will construct and operate the systems.  The extent of success of the competitive tendering will be measured by the resulting lowest subsidy required to deliver the outputs and manage the systems.",

The improved productivity will increase the storage of carbon both above- and below-ground.\n  The project also contributes to improvements in the quality of life of local impoverished Zenu indigenous population, and Afro-Colombian communities, through the labor and forest product revenues related to the reforestation program as well as a fraction of the of the carbon revenues as incentive for sustainable ecosystem management. The increase in carbon sink will not change the nature of the Savannah ecosystem. The reforestation will be implemented in traditional forest areas around the piedmont of the Andes. The BioCarbon Fund intends to purchase around 200,000 t CO2e in carbon sinks. A letter of intention has already been signed.

Okyeman is endowed with natural resources of global importance, including diverse terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity, endemic and globally threatened fauna and flora.  These resources are being destroyed by the adverse impacts of human activities such as deforestation, water pollution and over-harvesting of wildlife.  Recognizing the importance of nature and environmental conservation as the basis for the development of their people, the Traditional Authority is taking concrete steps to prevent further degradation of forest and water bodies in the traditional area.  This project will help to expand the scope of these initiatives, thereby optimizing their local and global environmental benefits and enhance sustainable forestry related economic activities.  It is expected that while this support will contribute toward ensuring environmental sustainability in the Akyem Abuakwa Traditional Area, it will also serve as a model partnership arrangement with traditional authority and when successful, could be replicated and scaled up in the country.

PDO achievement will be measured by the number of horticultural exporters and export-oriented producers, and their export volumes and values, as well as the area under horticultural production compliant with GAP standards. As this LIL tests the appropriateness of a tool (i.e. contract farming) to achieve these objectives, target values cannot be set for the objectives themselves, but rather for the service structures (such as Horticultural Export Promotion Department created and operational\"; \"16 Technology Transfer Specialists employed\"; \"quality testing laboratory upgraded and operational\") which aim at improving the business environment for using this tool.

The miombo is of outstanding international importance for the conservation of flora and fuana, many of which are endemic to the region. In response to the highly acidic soils of the miombo woodlands, the traditional farming system is the slash and burn where vegetation is removed from between 2-3 ha by farmers and burnt in plots averaging 0.3-0.4 ha. The ashes increase the ph of the soils and are a source of additional nutrients. This system supports a period of cultivation of up to 5 years. However, rapid population growth is increase pressure on land and progressively shortening the period of fallow. Decline in soil fertility has led to food insecurity. The rapid degradation of the soil is also of global concern. The project is intended to promote a shift from slash and burn to more sustainable land management practices which have been successfully tried in other areas. These practices include the application of conservation farming (CF) at the farm level and integrated ecosystem management (IEM). Examples of CF are crop rotation, no- or minimum tillage, use of agricultural lime and the use of crop cover crops. IEM measures includes community fire control and agroforestry. The vehicle that will be used in the promotion of these practices is the succesfully tested Farmer Field Schools.",

The FY04-07 CAS envisages that over the four-year period of CAS implementation, there could be two multi tranche Development Policy Lending Operations or one multi tranche plus two single tranche DPOs to support CAS implementation.   This credit#s reform program and objectives aim to facilitate Zambia:  \n #\tTo maintain and deepen Zambia#s macroeconomic framework conducive to robust growth;\n #\tTo strengthen the credibility and institutional capacity of the public sector; \n #\tTo enhance Zambia#s growth opportunities while improving its poverty impact.\n In addition, the expected results of the Credit are embedded in the CAS for FY08-11 and contribute to its goals and objectives. \n IDA and the Government of the Republic of Zambia agree that achieving these objectives in part depend on the implementation of specific reforms in the areas of:  (i) public sector management; (ii) macro economic management including the reduction of arrears and the establishment of a credit rating bureau; (iii) agriculture; (iv) infrastructure; and (v) business environment.",

        "Project Development Objective ": "The PDO is to support the acquisition of land and the formation of sustainable farm enterprises by self-organized landless and land-poor peasant families. As a pilot program, the Land Access Pilot Project (PACTA) tests a public-private partnership strategy with interested private sector lending institutions for land purchase and the use of public sector funds, through the project, supporting complementary investments, and technical assistance to improve the productivity of the newly acquired properties. If successful, the Government would consider scaling up the pilot to a national fund mechanism for land purchase in several years.  The concentration of the best lands among a small percentage of landholders (less than 4% of farms have more than 50% of total land) in Honduras makes it extremely difficult for family scale producers to participate effectively in the land market. Private land is available to the smallest producers, since they do not have the needed collateral and cannot bid on the larger size productive plots that more often enter the market. PACTA is therefore designed to provide an economy of scale to small rural producers who wish to purchase land for productive activities. Such transfers would be likely to result in more intensive land uses. While individuals can also be beneficiaries, the majority of the participants are expected to be groups of producers who collectively identify land for sale, develop a business plan for that land, and assume collective responsibility for investment and repayment until the loan is paid off, and they can exercise their individual rights over their own parcels. Key performance indicators: (i) Volume of lending leveraged from private financial institutions for land purchase -,,Financial institutions develop appropriate methodology to deliver credit products for land purchase by target population; and devote at least US$2.5 million to this purpose. -,,At least seventy-five percent of families identifies as eligible by the Unidades Tecnicas Locales receive private financing for land purchase.  (ii) Quality of the loan portfolio -,,At least eighty-five percent of groups participating in the project are able to pay off land purchase loans and maintain viable enterprises (participant families negotiated land purchase, established legal structure, entered into credit contracts, and expanded new enterprises). (iii) Increase in income of participating families -,,At least 15% increase on family income through land productivity and output in acquired lands. (iv) Validation of a decentralized model for land access -,,Pilot evaluation leads to endorsement of expansion of program and PACTA is established as a national program operating in conformity with the tested implementation model. (v) Local social accountability and constituency building around the program -,,The functions attributed to the Consejo Directivo de PACTA have been absorbed by the Redes Regionales de Apoyo (the Regional Support Networks) to provide the constituency that would support the transformation of PACTA from a pilot project to a national program. The Regional Support Networks provide an articulation of operative local and national alliances, strengthen the project?s policies and procedures, enrich its norms and operational manual, and provide a social accountability for the use of funds.",

The objective shall be achieved by updating their management plans and implementing the corresponding measures, including if such option is confirmed by establishing a NGO Biodiversity Resource and Research Centre on Praslin island, the second largest island in Seychelles, only 2km away from Cousin, 3 km from Cousine and 6km from Aride and by funding scientific & education officers and local counterparts.  An important objective of the improved management plans will be to reduce human pressure in order to remove threats of pollution, intensive human use and loss of naturalness. This would be achieved by limiting the numbers of permanent staff, researchers and their equipment to a minimum on each island and by improving the management of the flow of visitors. Another objective will be to promote more research, education and awareness activities as well as maximise the use of scarce human resources to benefit all three islands through the exchange of staff and collaboration on joint programs. The establishment of new facilities such as the Praslin Centre would thus improves delivery to a broader array of stakeholders, whilst improving the sustainable use of the islands.   Praslin is well situated for the housing the Biodiversity Resource and Research Centre.  Praslin is a tourist resort island and it is served by air and surface links and has excellent communications and utilities.

The objectives will be attained through implementation of the following key components (i) demand management and irrigation improvement; (ii) supply management and recharge improvement; (iii) institutional development and capacity building (improving the analytical data base for water resources management); (iv) information and public awareness; (v) environmental management and mitigation program; (vi) project management and monitoring; and (vii) follow-on-project preparation.",

The project's overall objective is to demonstrate the viability of ecological corridors in conserving biodiversity in the Brazilian Amazon and Atlantic rainforests. The project is divided in two phases: The first phase will take approximately 18 months and will focus largely upon establishing the institutional infrastructure for the Central Amazon (CAC) and Atlantic Forest(CAFC) corridors, and developing management plans based upon multi-disciplinary studies of biodiversity and related economic, social and political characteristics relevant to successful corridor management. It will also launch the first conservation initiatives and pilot techniques derived from the corridor management plans. By the end of the 18 month-phase it is expected that significant progress will have been made in establishing prototype corridor management institutions and plans that would orient implementation efforts in the second phase. During the second phase, with an expected duration of 42 months, the project will focus on the consolidation of corridors monitoring and vigilance systems, implementation of corridors management plans and implementation of sub-projects in interstitial areas.",
