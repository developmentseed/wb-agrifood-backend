Based on a randomized controlled trial, this study assesses the effects of ‘farmer-to-farmer’ extension and a video intervention on adoption of a complex technology package among 2,382 smallholders in Ethiopia. Both extension-only and extension combined with video increase adoption and knowledge of the package, especially of its more complex components; although on average, there is no additional effect of the video intervention on adoption.

This paper investigates farmers’ demand for one such measure, namely agricultural advisory services. These have modest (most frequently zero) monetary user cost but, according to some recent research, have the potential to result in large increases of yields. Yet, demand for these extension services is often low. This study proposes that costly attention may be part of the explanation for this. In the model, advisory services are available free of charge, but positive effects on production are only realized if farmers devote attention to listening to and implementing the provided advice. Modeling farmers as rational decision makers facing scarce attention, the study identifies the circumstances under which farmers may optimally abstain from demanding advisory services. The model complements the insights of other theories commonly used to explain suboptimal farm decisions and outcomes, and generates testable predictions, which are consistent with empirical evidence based on a large farm-level panel dataset from Sub-Saharan Africa.', 'date': '2-Feb-21', 'type': 'Policy Research Working Paper', 'authors': \"['Naeher', 'Dominik', 'Schundeln', 'Matthias']\", 'sectors': \"['Food Security', 'Agricultural Extension', 'Crops and Crop Management Systems', 'Climate Change and Agriculture', 'Inequality', 'Information Technology', 'Livestock and Animal Husbandry']\", 'implementer': 'Off of Sr VP Dev Econ/Chief Econ (DECVP)', 'url': 'http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/885441612294787514/pdf/The-Demand-for-Advice-Theory-and-Empirical-Evidence-from-Farmers-in-Sub-Saharan-Africa.pdf'}]\n",

In the context of the Ukraine Agriculture Recovery Inclusive Support Emergency (ARISE) Project, financial accessibility was addressed through a two-pronged approach aimed at enhancing the resilience and sustainability of the agricultural sector amidst significant challenges, including conflict and natural or man-made disasters. Firstly, affordable credit was made available to farms, facilitating capital investment and operational continuity. This component targeted the broader agricultural ecosystem, ensuring entities of varying sizes could access the financial resources necessary for recovery and future growth. Secondly, the project instituted a grant system specifically tailored for small farms, recognizing the disproportionate impact of crises on smaller scale operators and the vital role these entities play in local food security and rural economies. Both methods were instrumented through the Business Development Fund and the Ministry of Agrarian Policy and Food, ensuring tailored, effective deployment of resources.
